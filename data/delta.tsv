1464119235655970819	my god—the new #b11259 variant being possibly ~500% more competitively infectious is the most staggering stat yet. also, #nuvariant has more than &gt;2x the number of bad spike mutations than delta. here’s an updated   model by @jpweiland matches up with graph by @jburnmurdoch  https://t.co/sfvfebd7qo	9941
1464242228952510472	cnn: major us airlines say they are closely watching the new south african coronavirus variant that is triggering new travel restrictions in europe. delta, united, and american airlines all tell cnn they’re monitoring the situation.	6546
1464405103759216643	seriously?  “delta variant” wasn’t a scary enough, apocalyptic, end times science fiction disease name?!  now we gotta have “omicron”?!?	4778
1464270951894425602	this is the perfect dip for buying.   the markets are responding to a new variant and we have seen this before with the delta variant. there is initial panic and then we accept it and move on.	4776
1464621961426911242	— the bad news: omicron, now detected in the uk, has “32 mutations on the spike protein alone. as a comparison, delta had 9 changes on the spike protein.” that matters because “the spike is the key into our cells. if the virus changes to become a smarter key, we need to know.”	4469
1464525848569171975	new variant  what do we know?  known cases so far have not been seriously ill. south african health department say “ storm in a tea cup “  no evidence that it’s more transmissible or more deadly chris whitty more concerned about delta currently.  stop the fearmongering	4446
1464257091896549382	i am begging people to stop saying that b.1.1.529 is x times more transmissible than delta. we literally have no idea right now and you’re only panicking people. wait for more data.	4195
1464598190561415168	of course ! he has to distract us from the nightmare he’s currently having.   chris whitty has stated this variant isn’t as worrying as the delta variant . ( remember johnson allowed his trade visit to india to influence the delta spread ).	3497
1464224843310718980	what are those three to pay attention to?  is it more transmissible than current strain (delta)?  does it cause more severe disease?  and does have it more immune escape (will it render prior infections or vaccines less effective)?  so lets talk quickly about what we know  2/5	3236

1464297917221588994	"""nu"" or ""omicron"" is a double edged weapon to excuse failures of governance &amp; implement more tyranny. just as delta was reason why the lockdowns failed, this ""new variant"" will be the excuse for the shots.   ""it wasn't us, it was that damn mutation, caused by the non-compliant!"""	2981

1464427258119176198	there will be no covid zero, no delta zero and no variants zero. we have a vaccine. get it. mask if you want. mitigate. time to move on. lockdowns and school closures are no longer necessary or warranted. learning to live with the endemic is necessary.	2842
1464211081799376905	we are in a pandemic that spreads through the air.  anti-mask headlines in major papers have done as much harm as if they were anti-vaccine headlines.   please print the truth: vaccines and masks work. we are going to need both, against delta, nu, &amp; whatever is to come.	2808
1464607376292601879	cdc has info on # in us who had covid already and thus, accdg to dozens of studies, are unlikely to get it again, but they have been covering it up since may 29 prior to big delta spread. back then it was 129 million. it's our info; they work for us.	2531
1464332094960812037	here’s my #newprofilepic in an upgraded mask. #omicronisairborne and is more transmissible than delta. we all need better-fitting, high-filtration masks, worn indoors (especially on public transport).  https://t.co/dv1v2pgzvq	2515
1464277936450715661	1/2 my view on the new variant: i think we need to separate virus transmissibility from vaccine escape. we've had vaccine escape mutants before like beta and lambda that never really went anywhere, whereas alpha and delta were highly transmissible and overwhelmed populations...	2502
1464410605402480641	the mutation map of the 5 variants of concern adapted from  https://t.co/2sg39czzsj omicron (b.1.1.529) shares many key mutations of alpha, beta, gamma &amp; delta, but a lot more added, very likely having been derived from an immunocompromised host with extensive in vivo evolution  https://t.co/q6lvtzop8s	2240

1464598138166169600	"new york state has declared a state of emergency over the ""omicron variant.""   100% of tested samples over last 2 weeks came back for delta sequence. yes, 100%.   kathy hochul's state of emergency is fraudulent. it's an excuse for false promises, &amp; a rationale for more tyranny.  https://t.co/9sd5dhyv1l"	2035
1464257899069280261	the unanswered questions are important ones. even if a variant creates more difficulty for the immune system, it’s rate of spread is important. if it doesn’t outcompete delta, it will likely be more limited in its reach as long as delta continues to spread. 11/	2028
1464353267123560448	growth rate (in absolute terms and relative to delta) will be become clearer in the following days, but at the moment, i believe we're looking at a variant that potentially has significant immune evasion and that appears to be spreading rapidly. 15/16	2000
1464360454868848643	finally, remember that omicron like alpha/delta arose from an unvaccinated population.  had g7 leaders committed to vaccinating the african continent we would not be having this discussion. there's not enough mrna/adeno to vaccinate global south, but lots of our protein vaccine	1964

1464358265425481729	first, omicron from the reports i've seen so far does not appear to cause more severe disease than alpha or delta, it's not the andromeda strain.	1841
1464257900663037953	we’ve all gotten nervous enough that it’s worth answering the question, “but what if it does evade prior immunity and outcompetes delta?” 12/	1770
1464234857719021577	same sars-cov-2 virus we have been dealing with for almost 2 years now. stop that. give me a break. to those saying it is “outcompeting” delta. important thing to keep in mind: there hasn’t been much delta to displace or “outcompete.” until last week, south africa was at its	1749
1464234988191289351	lowest incidence rate since the beginning of the pandemic. in other words, the low incidence of delta in south africa kinda means that nu becoming dominant is weaker evidence of it “outcompeting” it when there really wasn’t much to outcompete so to speak.	1687
1464018729394753538	@rwhetstone9 triple vaxxed is good. any mask is better than no mask. i just don't know how contagious this new variant is if it spreads here &amp; delta is highly contagious. what i'm hearing about this new variant is potentially very alarming. n95s are what i'll be wearing.	1665
1464264400358055942	third: what we should do?  reduce transmission now!  delta arrived in uk during lockdown - it still spread but harder for it to infect others.  right now very easy for a new variant to spread - let's make it harder with e.g. masks &amp; home working &amp; hepa filters indoors. 5/5	1661
1464058581502738435	people are asking what i think about the b.1.1.529 variant that is rapidly increasing in frequency in south africa.   it certainly merits close monitoring.   that said: i believe the hockey-stick graphs from yesterday are in error. we are nowhere near the delta peak prevalence.	1603
1464387060794638345	"did travel restrictions curb the spread of the ""delta variant"" in the slightest? now we're going for another round...?"	1598

1464235329523789824	vaccine equity is vital. variants pop up out of low vaccinated areas. immune evasion may not be needed to spread and fitness could easily differ in higher-vaccinated countries, and those dominated by delta. i also recommend reading this thread here:  https://t.co/6noutvxbey  https://t.co/jq8bpbifej	1452
1464300672405450758	omicron: my big concern is transmissibility, we’ve had other immune escape variants like beta and lambda which never took off. the key question: more or less transmissible and can it out compete delta?	1408
1464356872073494539	as a practicing physician treating covid patients, we are not testing for delta variant nor will we test for omicron variant	1401
1464246147132887045	right wingers didn't take mask mandates, shutdowns or vaccination seriously. now we are seeing a new south africa variant that will make delta look like a picnic. the virus doesn't care if you are a moron but if you ever want the pandemic to end, stop being one.	1398
1464554375091732482	4) we need to first figure out how widespread it is, how well it escapes neutralizing antibodies (assumption: very well), what its r0 is, how well it does against delta and if it can cause severe disease in vaccinated or recovered individuals.	1393
1464120315806691354	2) that spike in #b11259 displacing delta has now caused shockwaves worldwide. it is really bad. not only that but the previous #c12 variant also seems to be slowly growing and displacing delta too in south africa.	1384
1464234992242937857	you can see for yourself here. with relatively low cases, this may left a void which a new variant could spread into more easily- it likely hasn't had to compete with delta and in other countries where delta rages on, it very well may not be as fit.  https://t.co/ae07oafgqx	1352
1464278195428020230	2/2 ...therefore a key question heading into the weekend is whether there is evidence that this new variant is significantly more transmissible than delta, and whether the rise in south africa cases is really due to this new variant?	1323
1464573317558407172	the world health organization announced friday that it deems the new variant of the coronavirus circulating in southern africa, the b.1.1.529, a variant of concern, and has named it omicron. it's the first new variant of concern since delta.	1264
1464407205247995905	the proclamations of impending supervariant omicron doom for vaccinated people may be premature…  …small case numbers and still early days but this is pretty similar to what we see with delta	1219
1464259611054198791	i understand: being worried about variants in other countries and putting in precautionary measures (b.1.1.529 is the most concerning variant i have seen since delta.)  i don’t understand: waiting to take action while cases and hospitalisations are spiking in your own country.	1157

1464344409747517449	@delta____wither this is a truly hilarious bit. the fact that you seemingly actually committed to the 147 tweet thread like an unhinged person is extremely funny. probably the best parody of a crypto guy i’ve seen in a while.	1083
1464359683230162946	fifth, in the meantime the delta variant in unvaccinated or under vaccinated populations is one of the leading killers in america.  41% of the us population remains unvaccinated, including kids and adults who are defiant. also waning immunity from 2 mrna doses - get your booster	1061
1464194947830235148	irresponsible of people talking about lockdowns now, absolutely no evidence this is more deadly than current strains, no evidence that it could rapidly spread in a high prevalence delta country either.. ie the u.k  people are terrified and it might be over nothing.  shameful	1060
1464556971454083072	elimination zones struggled with delta but managed to do this through strong public messaging &amp; aggressive action in many places. with every shift in the virus we risk dealing with a shift in the pandemic, and every step threatens elimination in places that fought hard for this.	1045

1464663909638541314	having read the credible commentators on omicron the message is that delta’s left us with no wriggle room for mistakes but rather than apply a precautionary principle now, imposing serious constraints, we’ll wait for three weeks whilst it spreads and then find we’re f****d again	91
1464642051539189776	this does sound like the sort of fast action that we should have done with delta: border control, face masks, self-isolation on contact, more boosters.  this is not a lockdown.	91
1464246309515411460	well having read some proper experts on the nu variant i am less worried than i was this morning but taking it very seriously as i do with delta.  get jabbed/ wear a mask/ listen to scientists.	91
1464035957452251141	whatever you thought you could get away with, however you thought you were going to fight it or emerge from it, even with delta, this changes all that.   so given we are facing this very very worrying new variant, maybe we can use this to change things around? (7/10)	91
1464376144539516930	omicron hasn't evolved from delta. it appears to derive from a pre-delta variant in mid-2020, and then circulated undetected in low numbers since, before accumulating a large number of mutations. in a developing region, mostly likely southern african, but not south africa.	91
1464653195041378313	definitely premature to draw any conclusions, but just about the best possible thing that could happen at this point is a variant many times more transmissible than delta that generally causes much milder illness  https://t.co/our9b1ttjv	91

1464378862704287744	gosh. it's from an old strain, in covid terms. not a delta descendent.	52
1464300116995559426	it's all about branding and marketing.  delta worked.  nu sounds too much like 'new' and would confuse the masses.    omicron™ is a more ominous and threatening.  it leaves you with questions.  it feels unknown.  we are living through unbelievable psychological warfare.	52
1464170237306327050	overall, i think the worries about the new variant might be overdone though.  the hk patient was $pfe vaccinated - and totally asymptomatic. as with delta, we’ll most likely see breakthrough infections. but ve against severe disease probably still &gt;80%.  https://t.co/ixiw6fuxme	52

1464374941894144004	@ingridkatzmd @ohohyeah the delta variant spread all over the world because people travelled and brought it all over the world. if we had stopped travel immediately with delta, it would never have become the dominant strain. now we have a more transmissible variant. limit travel ;mandatory mask mandates	49
1464476997652992006	we contradict ourselves if we are not consistent. last year delta was picked up in india. some amongst us called for borders to be closed. here is the thing, the virus does not have a passport. travel bans are absolutely useless if local transmission cannot be controlled.	49

1464092587665412102	there are also possibilities of this variant being more transmissible.  we also do not know yet much about the disease that it causes - will it be more severe than delta ?  since this has just come into knowledge, unanswered questions outnumber answered ones.	36

1464290006646902790	@dailymailuk there is no evidence as of now that the nu variant is causing any more illness to those infected than does delta. sa health ministers stated this morning that there is no evidence of vaccine evasion. no reason at all to impose new restrictions in the uk.  https://t.co/q9lwztyael  https://t.co/bmjcvtojnm	14

1464359094593069058	@jo_moir nz's strategy is to control what we can control - delta within our borders. until the whole world is highly vaxxed, covid will continue to be an ever present threat. dangerous new variants, like omicron, will easily enter our country from overseas with an open border policy.	14

1464223759829766145	and remember right now delta is coming at you from all sides in the usa. if you dropped your multilayered protections,  it's a great time to put on your mask and stay mindful of the density of your interactions. that will help protect you from any variant.	14
1464358741583835148	while we wait for real world data on whether omicron escapes immunity &amp; transmits more effectively than delta, let’s agree that 1 dose of mrna vax is better than 0, 2 doses better than 1, 3 doses better than 2, &amp; we better get all 3 into everyone everywhere as soon as possible.	14

1464378965208961025	virulence - we don't know yet if infection with omicron will lead to more serious illness, but so far there seems to be a variety of responses as we see with delta, including some asymptomatic infections. as with all of the early info here, this is to be confirmed (tbc).	12
1464644511242629123	we went from 'delta variant' to 'omicron.' they're making the names scarier to try and get people to take it more seriously. i look forward to the next variant, galactus the world eater.	12
1464540307869945859	also, the primary reason for pointing out that covaxin effectiveness against delta is lower (which it is), is because the vaccine was approved on the basis of the claim that it would outperform other vaccines against variants. it didn't.	12
1464301611417841667	here is the who statement on omicron. note that beta (also identified in south africa) had a similar profile: lots of reinfections. neither alpha nor delta reinfected much. so this bears watching.  https://t.co/pjqzijyqbt	12

1464114673565900801	assuming 529 is more transmissible than delta:  • if severity is low, then it will only be problematic for economic growth in zero-tolerance countries (china, hk)  • if severity is high, then it could delay the recovery from covid-19 by 6-12 months, at the very least	12
1464028498000064512	@fitterhappieraj yep, the virus has had chance to “learn” from people (probably vaccinated adults), but kids whose bodies have never seen wildtype/alpha/delta now potentially get hit with this one first. even if there’s some evasion i want my kids protected with a current vaccine.	12
1464265838027018257	approaching two years into this and seeing cases rising again with delta as we enter winter and hearing about a new emerging variant of concern in south africa, well, it's really just a lot.	12
1464352478971891715	it seems incredibly preemptive &amp; presumptous to assume that vaccines, therapeutics, treatments &amp; prior immunity are somehow not going to be able to stand up to a variant that is more transmissible than delta yet only being identified outside africa through routine pcr testing.	12

1464273739806355457	i feel like the fact that everyone is freaking out at this point about this new variant might be a reflection of a) learning lessons from last winter/delta variant and b) not having a lot of data to work with	8

1464636845409591303	@tlowdon randi weingarten reports that millions in florida were o’microned overnight. given that most of us had been delta’d already, that basically leaves just @christinapushaw, @jeremyredfernfl, @kylamb8, @frognews, and a handful of russian ‘bots. sad!	8
1464195586521853952	@flossyflange he says the vaccine will be 40% less effective against the new variant. so let me get this straight, the vaccine didn’t stop you from getting or passing on the  delta virus, so how can the vaccine be any more useless than against this new  made up bs variant??	8

1464119950239358979	had to figure that delta was not going to be the final form of the sars-cov-2 virus.   seemed only a matter of time for a new variant to emerge that could beat out the dominant delta strain.  this may get ugly here in the us, what with so many people fighting against ph measures.	8
1464191996940062725	worth pointing out that there also exists a universe where the next covid variant is more effective at spreading than delta, but less lethal. that combination would eventually end the pandemic.  can't imagine we'll get that lucky in 2021. but you never know.	8

1464437524168908802	so, a new variant popped up. early data says it's much more transmissible than delta. you might recall delta became the dominant because it was more transmissible than alpha. a plea: get your vaccine... not to save you (though it could). but to stop the spread to others.  https://t.co/6bynk3f4er	8

1464156182826782728	snapshots of the #covid19 #delta variant across timelines show a four month window before the spread of the variant becomes very dominant (start mar-startjul). it is therefore key to map the new #b11529 strain against the delta variant for both transmissibility and mortality.  https://t.co/glwmqwa2lh	7

1464604128915730440	"@cathynewman @sajidjavid @borisjohnson @channel4news i very much doubt it.   it'll be ""alas"" and ""please wear a mask"" but no compulsion, and no action to improve ventilation, particularly in school.   just like delta, this is another #johnsonvariant that may well cost lives and livelihoods completely unnecessarily."	6
1464471319995551748	the reasons are obvious -   1. the 32 mutation in the spike protein almost makes it far different then the previous delta, and alpha strains. this has implications for vaccine efficiency. (compiled by covidrxexchange)	6
1464214503151833091	@drelidavid has there been any evidence that travel restrictions have slowed the spend of covid-19? the delta variant spread widely quite easily. can run but not hide.	6
1464416841472774146	@paulmeekperth we have such little data but omicron seems to be largely asymptomatic, suggesting it's far more widespread than is believed. now might be a good time to look at orders for a vaccine when it becomes available. or in a few months like we did w/ delta, whatevs.	6
1464067670987345922	@cnn must be the delta-rewards-plus variant.	6
1464251377698410497	three weeks after the santa barbara wellhead failed, it is still blasting water, gas and oil across nembe in nigeria's delta, littering the shoreline and water with yellow-brown clumps of waste as cleanup crews and booms struggle to contain it.  https://t.co/wzosnmghoa	6
1464239685522309133	@goldiluxes @bnodesk all we can hope for at this point is this variant is less deadly then delta. but i doubt it because they have picked up virus levels in pfizer vaccinated people almost comparable to unvaccinated people with delta virus levels. which suggests more virulent too.	6

1464140423920685062	the good news: the new covid variant identified in south africa was spotted early and has a small number of cases  the bad news: it has 2x+ the mutations of delta and appears to be spreading much faster  who expected to name it nu variant today   https://t.co/qlqfhjhc2z	6
1464301482392629252	@shane_maps despite all of the random responses, i'm not sure there is an abundance of evidence to suggest that nu will outcompete delta.	6
1464188965616033793	@curiousdatacat @melaniesdavis @billresistance2 @mls_dave so far, the vaccines provide coverage for delta variant, but yes, the cdc should have maintained mask recommendations until here immunity is reached	6

1464365042019622914	@gdogimabbonit it’s been designated omicron, maiwan; it’s still very early days, but, it looks like… i’ll put it this way, if ‘delta’ were malaria, ‘omicron’ would be dengue; and that’s not even the best part, the next variant may well be like having both conditions concurrently, i imagine…  https://t.co/6aymunawoa	6
1464015344180371458	@degs99 @sue54704923 @erictopol @who @nature @ewencallaway @jburnmurdoch @ft yeah, could just be pure chance. with cases low in south africa imagine a superspreader event that just by chance happens to be the new variant, then it will look much more transmissible than delta just by pure chance even if it’s much less. or it could also be really bad.	6
1464014832256970752	- are booster shots in aged care being done as a matter of urgency?  - do we have supply if/when 5-11 yo are authorised to act immediately?  - do we have enough supply for boosters now? - early days, a new variant worse than delta in south africa? will lnp stop flights for now?	6

1464413490173652995	@bioturbonick @enirenberg yeah, i don’t get this. it’s entirely too dismissive. the key here is that it’s a highly differentiated polymutant with worrisome characteristics that now appears to be able to spreading widely and perhaps outpace delta.	6

1464609577568194568	@hana___anah with so many volunteer hosts for the virus to mutate inside, it's going to be an issue. remember delta was 1000x more contagious than the first variant, which also was made mutating inside a host anti-vaxxer. masks, eyes &amp; i'm going to start wiping it all down again just in case.	6
1464064766675144704	@nermalone @charmanjonathan @tuliodna with high levels of infection-based immunity, we'd expect another variant to eventually outcompete delta, as delta's immune escape ability is fairly limited.	6

1464232745765322754	if it’s outperforming delta then it’s everywhere already, just a matter of sequencing/testing for it. seems like this is the first one that will evade existing antibodies/vaccines too with the spike mutation, not good. holiday travel + indoor winter will spread it like crazy too.	6

1464239006313549828	@jamespmcleod @emmmacfarlane imo because they are not effective. delta got into countries with the strictest entry protocols; and unlike canada they don’t rely on 10,000+ trucks a day crossing the border. the reality is we know what has to happen; vax, mask, crowd limits. we can do that before icus fill up.	4

1464641995784306694	if omicron, by good fortune, turns out to be more contagious and much less deadly, such that it outperforms delta, we'll never hear the end of it from anti-vaxers and disease accelerationists who'll find a way to feel vindicated.  but honestly i don't care, i just want kisses	4
1464641790602985472	@daggerettube @erictopol it is just a matter of time. if breakthroughs happened with delta it is ridiculous to expect they won’t happen with omicron.  let’s just hope our cellular immunity offers a good head start. we need antivirals now, now, now	4

1464644699705196544	so government advice is to not wear masks.  get a vaccine but it's up to you.  just go about your life the same way that sees 50k new infections of delta.  hello omicron with r=2.0.  these bastards need to be prosecuted.	4
1464028317607104532	@crabbbrendan so pandemic, rising with each new variant wave. current vaccines resulting in epidemic waves of delta, converging on endemic (slowly with each subsequent wave). without further mitigations to maintain long-term r&lt;0.8, the race is b/w improved vaccine and the next major variant?	4

1464123865882374162	the botswana variant is rapidly spreading faster than delta and vaccines probably have 0% effectiveness against it because of spike protein mutations.  this is basically a whole new virus. lockdowns are coming. $usoil may go negative again because of supply chain/storage issues.  https://t.co/7q9g8xspu5	3

1464291305543147530	however a new variant that can rapidly outcompete delta could potentially cause a larger wave, especially as winter is coming when virus spread more easily and the uk’s poorly managed healthcare system is close to breaking point anyway	3
1464118555780157440	@faheemyounus when we dont know enough as of now - going by the devastation delta has caused earlier - it is better to err on the side of caution. so people must avoid crowds, do double masking, work from home once again and get vaccinated.	3

1464226621972520963	@roy_sam23 yep absolutely, but as covid (especially with this new variant + delta) is more transmissible and more deadly than flu then it's definitely something to be concerned about. i'm not saying i have answers, i'm challenging you saying it shouldn't be taken seriously....	3

1464573291654488065	@dr_perreault just conjecture. it has some mutations that have reduced antibody effectiveness in other mutants and in sa it looks like it might be overtaking delta. but cases are low right now so it overtaking delta could be a founder effect. 77 cases of omicron in sa so far yesterday.	3

1464579154993725444	@thekirahensley @abettel it's the same formula that uses the alpha spike blueprint, and alpha is probably out of circulation by this point. without manipulated numbers it only worked at around 30-40% against delta, so no it probably won't help at all	3
1464560761628508162	@colindotnet @linesvick @peterhotez it did not overtake delta in the first two weeks. you have absolutely zero idea what you are talking about. the one absolute thing we know right now, sa had very little delta. it can’t overtake something that isn’t there. i’m starting to think you’re a gas lighting account	3

1464314246976749570	@bopanc @biontech_group what about #delta which is dominant now, and still the same composition for boosters... what is this game?!?	3
1464176583246336002	two main points causing concern re the new covid-19 variant:   1) it's becoming the dominant variant in south africa at a faster initial speed than beta &amp; delta.   2) mutation profile (32 in spike protein, much higher vs delta) means potentially significant immune evasion.  #oott  https://t.co/opalpxnqrp	3
1464297328555315202	@sharestruth nobody knows if it requires a different vaccine.  but if it is like delta, it probably doesn't.  basically the mutations make it more transmissible but my bet is that the current vaccines are just as likely to prevent serious sickness with this variant.	3

1464476591669403651	@jillastark hard to get your head around the possibility that #omicron might be nastier than the delta cousin we have all come to know.  a tricky little mutation that can avoid current vaccines. using the term “going viral” is coming back to haunt us. #auspol #covidvariant #covidiots #auspol	3
1464493514377641986	that there could be a variant that is as infectious as delta and as dangerous as ebola,” said the doctor to the newspapers of the funke media group. the new south african variant b.1.1.529 is a good example of the fact that the virus should not be given a chance to mutate.	3
1464226523452424192	"b.1.1.529 reported in africa, has a ""very unusual constellation of mutations"" with over 30 in the spike protein alone, reported by one #scientist. in dec. of 2020  south africa was the first nation to report cases of the  beta variant, and the delta variant continues to spread.  https://t.co/ycm5zjcd8b"	3
1464458600114536449	@johnstoneyt i think these are the worst remakes just because the others have been so much better than the originals; frlg had the sevii islands, hgss had some of the best visuals of the entire series, and oras had the delta episode  bdsp is fun but it doesn’t expand on base dp enough imo	3
1464408417544646659	@cryptokaleo just like the delta dip....just another variant and overblown panic.  blip on the radar in grand scheme	3
1464228191283953665	@kakape it may not be outcompeting delta either, south africa was at the bottom of a wave with barely any cases. this variant didn't have much to compete with.	3
1464320579750838277	how many remixes of covid-19 do we have now ? i didn’t keep up with it after the delta one	3
1464162818928918529	delta torpedoed the idea that vaccines can stop covid-19 spreading. so forget transmissibility as a factor. if b.1.1.529 can't penetrate that line of defence against severe illness, we can breathe easier.  the nicd only sticks its neck out if it's certain...	3
1464320882432745477	@bnodesk that means there is more than 1.000 around the world. i hope it can’t beat delta. that’s the point	3

1464563261135892480	another reason why its probably too late to ban travel. its a virus. it doesn't adhere to border closures and flight bans. anyone remember how delta got into their countries? 	3
1464162960310521857	@karlbrophy exactly, and it will eventually regardless, and if this one doesn't turn out to outcompete delta something else will. should be spending our effort getting the antivirals approved and in circulation and getting the 3rd doses done. on both we (europe) remains slow.	3

1464415088539017218	@erictopol our only hope is that infectivity increased (virus fitness) at the expense of its virulence (which can hurt fitness).   if that is true, the new variant would actually be helpful: it would compete out delta while causing fewer hospitalizations.	3

1464415080901013507	@njbbari3 we must. we (&amp; modi and his crew in india ) did not learn. variants of concern arise from large unvaccinated freely mobile populations. exhibit 1- delta. therefore, there should be the least number of unvaccinated mobile populace anywhere in the world. which means vaccine equity.	3

1464296092888178688	@jennycohn1 more data will likely reduce this %. even measles only has an r0 of 18, and delta turned out to be around 8. this would be like, what, 40? nothing has ever had that kind of transmission rate.	2

1464298377408036872	peyton manning famously yelled, omaha before every play call and this inbredneck will begin yelling, “omicron!” — it’s the brand new delta variant, even deadlier than its predecessors and it will soon shake hands with qaaron rodgers. #nfl #skol  https://t.co/wmyec7hcly	2
1464246798722154505	i have a hunch, if it’s anything at all, this variant will be just like delta. very transmissible, but not vaccine resistant. there’s always going to be new variants because covid isn’t going anywhere.	2
1464313782067367937	@goingprv4abit @what46hasdone full vaccine escape - very, very unlikely. our vaccines are polyclonal. they are attuned to several sites on the antigen and so a few mutations aren’t enough to evade it entirely. chances of vaccine effectiveness below delta - likely, and so get boosted.	2
1464257526938189830	@theleftovers46 @juli_bg_bs nobody knows anything about this variant yet let alone the highly specific numbers you just put in your tweet. the fear comes from its mutation profile (which may not be consequential), *apparent* fitness advantage over delta. there is no evidence for anything else at this stage	2

1464211365556457475	new variant 500x more infectious than delta which is 1200x more so than original covid-19. therefore, #nuvariant is 600,000x worse than original! and likely evades some/much antibody immunity.	2

1464473128340312064	@littlefolksays @hjelle_brian there is a nu that got stomped on my omicron. it's why we are still talking about delta and have not heard much about epsilon, zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi. omicron is scaring everyone...we have 9 more letters in the greek alphabet.	2
1464473425435672579	i am glad we have chosen omicron for the next potentially serious covid variation. delta sounded like the airplane company, omicron sounds like someone is summoning a demon straight from the middle layers of hell	2
1464473615286550529	"@noahpinion iirc the ""don't freak out"" was specifically in response to media narrative that delta breakthroughs would be common + lethal. providence, ""israeli data"" both of which were misinterpreted and amplified by press"	2
1464619832037494786	@baarablood okay so because you didn’t see him swap actual hands with kyuubi cloaked naruto, you just assume he can’t? that’s dumb.   i’m not arguing the delta shit anymore. y’all be making some wild ass claims and pick and choose how to remember that fight so y’all can have it lmao	2
1464473731028459520	@weed10_weed @reboticant yup. and it is racist in both cases. we'd never do this w/ uk, for example (and didn't for alpha). we didn't for delta &amp; india. we only do this w/ countries we don't like (china) or don't give a f*ck about (sa, etc.).	2
1464619812940775425	@kvoa how many variants will there be?  if we’re at delta and jumped to omicron, will we go back to beta and pick it there, or will we go to omega to make us think it’s over, only to revert iota and leap frog to tai, right before lambda. can i be at eta, while my wife is stuck at zeta?  https://t.co/imkmab2ibv	2
1464133146929250304	i think there’s a lot we don’t know about politics because some things are straight forward….there’s a new variant going around!! close the borders bro…we didn’t act ka delta variant and let people from india in!! let’s not repeat the same mistake	2
1464133054922899457	@independent_ie the vaccine doesnt even full stop the original or delta so does it matter	2
1464620586924138496	@notdred @toxchick42 @imbernomics so maybe an inferred bridge (e.g. delta nabs worked so why wouldn't omicron) with a post-eua obligation to monitor the specific nab's  and ve for omicron.	2
1464134251876544513	@jeremyward33 too early to say that. it may not be able to outcompete delta. just have to wait and see.	2
1464471219944579074	"real scientists will tell you more transmissible variants of lesser virulence are the norm.  this was the case with delta.     nothing in the article touches on pathogenicity.  50 mutations in a variant is indeed ""unprecedented"" and perhaps a bit suspicious."	2
1464621029142278147	we still don't know a lot about the omicron variant, but what we do know is pretty concerning. it completely outcompeted delta in sa in a short period of time and has a huge number of spike protein mutations which threaten to bypass vaccine and acquired immunity.	2
1464468442983985155	@gerberkawasaki people need a knock to get serious. india was jolted out of any reluctance by the delta tsunami	2
1464468522046824450	the reason why omicron is a variant of concern is the slope of the curve. it's 500% more aggressive than delta. we know reinfection is higher but we still don't know if it is more fatal or just more contagious. usually + contagious = - fatal.  that is why it is being monitored.  https://t.co/ftaatrxqxx	2

1464620933205823498	@dude_ab1ded @partphil hope beyond hope that the designation of omicron is just the science community being extra cautious, and that it ends up being more lambda than delta.	2
1464620926717153291	there’s a new variant, it’s even worse than the delta, spreads fast and is vaccine resistant. for the love of god get vaccinated!	2
1464470443818057733	@mileslunn @2closetocall we just don't know. it all depends on how much omicron evades vaccines.  if vax effectiveness is as high against it as against delta, we're in decent shape - might see another wave among unvaxxed, but it'd be small.  if ve decreases substantially, though, we're in deep shit.	2

1464619797656870912	@billius27 the answer is blindingly obvious: trumpet 3rd doses relentlessly and open them up to 50+ at 5-6 months post-2nd dose.  mandate respirators in edu, health, and essential services.  set indoor co2 standards.  every measure that we can use to mitigate delta applies to omicron.	2

1464478086397775873	@counterfeitmitt @annaruspa @ashishkjha the two most troublesome variants, delta and omicron, both developed in parts of the world where vaccination rates were far beneath the recommendation. if, globally, vaccination rates were higher, we would have seen fewer mutations and more easily contained outbreaks.	2
1464478359170080768	@selk67410621 @drericding they already suspect the vaccine will be 40% less effective than it is against delta, which is already less effective than it is against the wuhan strain that was used to develop it. omicron cases are in fully vaccinated people 1/2	2
1464131543618707460	in my opinion, when a new variant is discovered it is already too late. how did it work out with banning countries with the delta variant? its literally everywhere now. all you can maybe achieve is delaying the inevitable.	2

1464042053105373184	@amanda_silvers @87cr604 @anitahuberman you are comparing apples to oranges, vancouver and surrey are much different cities. surrey is a suburb, your crime rate should be similar to delta's. but as surrey becomes a major centre you need your own service, your own ability to set priorities and staffing levels.	2
1464042064048533508	@dampedspring it’s possible but unlikely in this case: covid is already asymptomatic for a lot of people thus there is not much evolutive pressure to make it less lethal. if it propagates faster because of faster multiplication it will be a bit more lethal (like delta)	2
1464631807182180353	good morning my friends. ignorant people  are really causing us more covid problems.  now, we have omicron variant which i'm sure will spread out. hopefully, it wouldn't be as much as delta. what can we do?	2

1464551596977795075	@davidpnoble63 just to add that i do think that some people are getting ahead of themselves making the assumption that this variant will evade current vaccines and/or be at least as virulent as the delta variant. i’m not aware that either has been established yet.	2

1464582224683028487	i'm gonna go on the record here as saying b.1.1.529/omicron seems pretty bad. i'm guessing existing mrna vaccines will be 50-80% as effective as vs delta, and natural immunity from earlier strains 60-90% as effective, plus greater baseline virulence.	2
1464582226213933058	delta spike was much more similar to the original; omicron probably means a new vaccine is needed. people who got a vaccine 6 months ago could well be as vulnerable to *severe* omicron now as unvaccinated people are to the original strain.	2

1464614176618283010	@laurie_garrett @trvrb 2/n omicron is displacing delta as infection with delta &amp; omicron appear to be somewhat mutually exclusive, not like such a totally different sars-cov-2 virus that recent prior immunity/concurrent infection with delta doesn't affect.	2

1464374676558254080	@missrobinson @nickefthimiou @zbasyouny with omicron? none.  with delta? lots from israel and some from the uk. it's looking to be rarer to get a breakthrough with delta vs boosted than it was to get a breakthrough with wild or alpha with a fresh 2nd dose.  uk data will be getting more robust soon.	2
1464373809704693767	never-ending... #omicron is a dangerous variant. kudos s. africa for rapid detection of it. @trvrb suggests it is bad: likely faster spread than delta and significant immune evasion.  see moderna's plan already in the works to redesign boosters.	2

1464647261196107776	@ander_hk delta is actually very close to wild type in terms of immune escape. delta’s big advantage was it could ramp up viral load quicker.   if you had antibodies from recent vaccine/infection then those handle it. but if antibody levels wane then can be overwhelmed.	2
1464636943459835912	@johncleese basically yes, but only in the long run (several years). the problem with the corona virus is, that it can produce a very high virus load in a very brief time (delta and omnicron), so it overruns the immune system quickly which hightens the danger for lung inflammation /collapse.	2
1464385024300441600	@jackposobiec lol no, as virus replicates and spreads leads to more mutations which can make the virus weaker or stronger. they didn't skip over it, it's just that after delta the variants either gave the virus little to no advantage #omicron #coronavirus #covid19  https://t.co/lg2rrv8jmw	2
1464647102307340290	"@ewerickson well, it's more infectious than delta, especially among younger people, and it's more vaccine-resistant. that sounds pretty close to ""worse""."	2
1464174400073351172	@emmadavie26 @undercovpilgrim @jburnmurdoch it's probably more vaccine resistant than delta, but it's still really important to get people vaccinated. the pfizer vaccine was 95% effective against infections from earlier strains but only 85% effective against delta. maybe it will only be 75% effective against nu.	2
1464382360770658306	@catherine___c early reports: a) highly infectious and edging out delta &amp; other variants  b) cases are very mild  if b) is confirmed it is really good news and may be a case for opening borders to get rid of delta, which results in 14-15% of cases being hospitalised ( in nsw)	2
1464637790721753088	@nlckstocks for all we know this strain is a mild variant on par with the common cold that wipes out delta and allows us all to finally move on with our lives again  https://t.co/psbpg1xxhv	2

1464239443309744129	@sailorrooscout no, but the vaccines keep it circulating in the population right now and are not as effective as shown in the delta. giving it curious time to mutate until it may not be effective at all and more deadly than ever before.	1

1464030688139784202	@guitarphilosphy @skivimaa the vaccines do not prevent the infection because it was made for the alpha variant. the delta variant is more transmissible and the vaccine is leaky. now they are talking about a new variant, all caused by the vaccine that mutates and does not stop infection.	1

1464044195593834497	@holysherm @maciejwais @jburnmurdoch depends on the level of immunity you get after having it. delta is infectious enough that most everyone would get it especially w/o vaccines. so if it provided significant immunity getting more infectious would just speed up the inevitable infection.	1
1464239316419416069	@spacpicks uhhhh.. you should do some more research on the new variant... it has twice the number of mutations of delta; it's possibly 500% more infections; and, we have no idea if vaccines protect against it. this is not just manipulation. this is fear.	1

1464160441781952512	@isabelhealy1 hi isabel - it appears to be even more transmissable than the delta variant; it's still unclear whether it can escape vaccine-induced immune responses; but it carries more genetic changes than other variants so it may have some new properties not seen before - more data is needed	1

1464194548956119074	the r of delta in the uk for example, is now ~ 1, so out competing it doesn't mean you were more transmissible than delta would be in the absence of prior infection, it just means that you are out-competing delta given the large number of delta-immune people. r~40 will not happen	1
1464194212115615750	but when 90% of people are immune the relative rates become 0.2 for rho, and 0.55 for sigma and sigma wins. so one way of understanding the possible advantage of putative nu is that it can reinfect more people than delta	1

1464562335822061571	since the new omicron covid variant is more contagious &amp; more deadly than the delta variant; we can expect more unvaxxed republicans kicking the bucket (&amp; unable to vote in 2022).  unfortunately, it represents a breakthrough infection potential to the vaxxed. mask &amp; distance!	1
1464562151671140356	@dieaardvark @cnn that simply explains how it originated. but now that this mutation exists, if it's more infectious than delta (and they think it it), it will overtake delta across the world. that's how viruses work - they continue to evolve to their advantage.	1

1464442873122725890	so the biggest take away today from learning about delta nu, is that it mutated in regions with low-vaccination and vaccine inequality. so not sharing vaccine patents is going to erase all the efforts of vaccinating people and resurge all over again. well done, drug companies.	1

1464469003477209088	@pmcdunnough i believe it’s overall lethality will be lessened, however if it’s transmissibility is increased markedly like delta, shorter incubation infers faster pathogenesis and higher viral loads leading to earlier clinical deterioration and higher fatalities.	1

1464630769343729673	@mulla4sale for neutrality after india kicked up a fuss because the indian variant that emerged there was way more lethal and contagious...its now called delta. earlier, variants were named after country where it emerged first.	1

1464630645808943106	delta (should have) taught us that it doesn’t matter where it was first reported or where it’s been particularly bad or how many travel restrictions we impose. a new variant will always reach “our shores” and mess us over as long as 30-40% of us insist on being stupid about it.	1

1464630582453977095	@zerohedge if it's that infectious, it will become the dominant strain in no time, the same way delta displaced prior variant. silver lining, it would appear that virulence and lethality can be inversely correlated. no reason to panic at this stage	1

1464631737363873805	from my father: “a japanese group predicted in august that only 4 additional mutations in delta (k417n, n439k, e484k and n501y) could render the virus resistant to antibodies, induced by pfizer. that “quartet” looks pretty close to #omicron: k417n, n440k, e484a, n501y!” scary!	1

1464627846194814980	in summary:  - it seems pretty likely that omicron will replace delta.  - it's plausible that omicron will be more dangerous than delta, and the effectiveness of vaccines and natural immunity will decrease.  - omicron is unlikely to make vaccines or treatments ineffective.	1

1464629015298326533	if omicron does turn out to be milder than delta, then this could potentially be good news in the short term. however the next mutation could just as easily take it to being more deadly and more transmissible. no room for complacency.	1

1464633112651042835	two cases of #omicron found in uk. these infections will have begun up to 2 weeks ago, meaning it’s had two weeks to gain a foothold. it’s 5x more transmissible than delta so we’re screwed basically.	1
1464633079566319616	@locke6654 omarion seems like the worst case scenario but the media tends to jump to conclusions with fear mongering headlines. (delta+) time will tell. they should name the next variant “bow wow”.	1
1464633036411047939	@real_itamara @judiehall9 they're named after the greek alphabet. alpha, beta, delta...etc...	1
1464632887475462145	@sirlionyt @sajidjavid @ukhsa lol after alpha, beta, gamma and delta, this genius was able to predict there might be an omicron. no way! how could they possibly have guessed new variants would continue the naming convention!	1

1464632676401487882	@zannyholiday @whereistruth17 it wasn’t. the nov 26 update catalogs that. in september, the page still held delta news from july.	1
1464632642180104194	@acyn to be sure, the evidence for effective as of current vaccines against omicron is a bit circumstantial: as with the delta variant, nearly all the cases are unvaccinated.  the odds of catching covid are way lower if you’re vaccinated.	1

1464632519744184322	brilliant question. how do they test for variants? alpha, delta, omicron? do we have accurate testing? enough resources? if we don't test for anti-bodies, then why should we give credibility to variant testing? #covidvariant ?	1
1464632425464610817	@mcjamesa @blokeonwheels we are better prepared than we were for delta. high and increasing levels of vaccination will help. don't panic mr mainwaring!!!	1
1464632392975540233	@nycmayorsoffice @timessquarenyc stop encouraging bad behavior by encouraging millions of people to come to ny/spread disease and overwhelm our health care system. we have delta and a so africa variant(shortly). at this time you should be designating covid hospitals so that non covid care can be safely delivered	1
1464632284171182090	@rwmalonemd the french government is pushing for the 3rd dose of vaccine. omicron seems more transmissible than the delta. they say it is very dangerous. i thought the more transmissible a virus was, the less lethal it was. i am not vaccinated at all. but i wanted your expert opinion ..	1
1464633228581560324	@timmycb5 certainly hope so but it has already proven to be many times more transmissible. we'd better start sacrificing jaffa cakes to the gods that it doesn't turn out as dangerous as delta	1
1464633297615691777	@thezvi good stuff but the calculated advantage of omicron over delta is implausibly large, likely due to noisy data. it implies a reproduction rate far higher than any other known respiratory pathogen.	1

1464634080604139532	@spkeene epsilon through mu turned out to be minor and not take over like delta. who decided against calling this new one nu yesterday cos it reads like “new” and could be confusing if/when another one comes along. they then also skipped xi for obvious reasons. so omicron it is!	1
1464634056214204417	@ethicalskeptic so that means that taking over from a post-peak outbreak doesn't even require an r greater than r0 for the source of that outbreak. iow we haven't even proven that omicron is more infectious than delta, let alone three times as infectious as .@yaneerbaryam claims.	1
1464633938186579973	@sha210 yes, kind of like with the beta variant that was discovered here. it had a higher mortality rate, but delta was more transmissable, and suppressed beta.	1
1464633920280875011	@boomsardonic @408nate @gregggonsalves @bfriedmandc found the guy that doesn’t understand exponential growth. if it’s more transmissible than delta, then preventing those early seeds when case numbers are still low does more to slow spread and buy time to understand the virus and implement public health measures.	1

1464633643666755586	@enirenberg but it's not the whole space, and for most populations with a lot of vaccination and/or prior wt/alpha/delta infections, i'm not even sure it's all that big a part of the space for any given npi.	1

1464659150349164544	@mge_de @lizhivhep @sailorrooscout we don’t have a choice if it’s as transmissible as it looks to be from initial data but second case *would* be good news. delta is so transmissible itself that everyone is due to get it, probably repeatedly. a milder version with cross reactive immunity would ameliorate that.	1
1464659480508047360	@beaniemacintosh don't think it's been around long enough for infections to be sequenced, 97% of new cases are delta, need to wait and see what omicron does.	1

1464660016674193409	@nevslin journalistic reporting on omnicron has been really subpar. no one mentions that the extra mutations of the variant aren't really new mutations. it appears more like a combo of beta and delta mutations.  hope more information comes out soon and it's good news.	1

1464649858250424337	@sonjalondon my personal opinion only, i've always gone with estimates that the original covid strain was r0 at 5+. delta has more spikes on the package, that maybe pushed us to 6-7+ in terms of being better able to attach, and less avoidable indoors when someone is infected...	1
1464649812528271360	so did they say the other day that because delta is the prominent strain here in mb (&amp; everywhere one assumes) that they aren’t testing for diff variants anymore? or just that they weren’t going to bother releasing that info?  i assume omicron is going to change that, and quickly	1

1464648230554279939	@freddiesayers masks benefit is pretty much marginal anyway against delta. if the new variant is really so much more transmissable than even delta then surely masks would be even less effective at reducing spread.	1

1464258344454086666	@snapshutter i just hope that data regarding its transmissibility is wrong (well not wrong, per se, but a small sample size giving us the wrong idea).  previous variants with immune escape weren't as infectious.  i hope that delta continues to outcompete this one.	1
1464258314079031308	@nickreeves9876 people are already fed up and sceptical of the current booster to cover us from delta. the roll out has been really slow and uptake low. booster 2.0 is really not gonna go down well with the public. a new jab every 3 months doesn’t sound like a practical solution.	1

1464368657631305732	absolutely correct. but based on all we know, particularly after reading dr. bedford's omicron summary, it safe to predict that for unvaccinated the omicron infections clinically would be equal or worse than delta.	1

1464363930340503565	@freedomis1st @nikkidjohnson @mls_dave the current efficacy of the vaccine with booster is still 95% against the delta variant. the news emerging about this new variant is that several spike proteins are different which may evade the vaccine. so it's not the same at all. hopefully it won't be as bad as feared.	1
1464363924351037446	@deddecco @kingbolby we don't *know* that it's more contagious than delta. however, it has mutations that are consistent with it being more contagious than delta. if it's 500% (5x) more contagious than delta, it might as well be a new pandemic. also, who officially named it omicron.	1
1464363830931296265	my guess on what omnicron (transformers unite!) will turn out to be based on previous vocs.  - more transmisable than delta (20%) - less symptomatic and less severe (-30%) - doesn't escape vaccines, but possibly reduces effectiveness a little  but 2 + 3 = no net gain	1

1464365467108352000	@wespegden mmmm. for the uk, it's quite clear that adding india to the red list earlier would have delayed the delta wave enough to cause significantly lower death toll (by giving more time to the vaccine rollout).	1

1464345581728501761	so the delta variant had an r naught of 8. i hear the nu variant has an r naught of 50. if that turns out to be true then we’re in for a rough winter ahead.	1

1464329089993555971	@charlesrittmann @rjpress @thespybrief yep. these mutations still could give omicron some advantage. alpha had 1 mutation on the spike protein, delta 3. omicron has 32. but as danielle said it can't evolve to be much worse or it'd evolve itself out of existence (so to speak). she put it much more elegantly, of course.	1

1464329036696485891	@antiboomerparty all i know it's that its viral load is about as high as delta and it evades immune systems pretty well. also the mutations have occured in spike proteins which means vaccines might not work as well against it. but early days.	1

1464329922562850818	@ketaminh we're almost 90% fully vaccinated in the over 12s now, which is the main difference. variants may cause some immune escape, but as with delta they're unlikely to completely nullify vaccines - esp  against severe illness. it's also in more countries than just southern africa.	1
1464330036639453185	@gerdosi surely the question shouldn't be whether or not it's new (delta wasn't), but whether or not we're doing things that actively select for it to become dominant.	1

1464336789150203904	@schwarah95 @thetweetofrhea i'm in aotearoa . we got in fast and early, acted as a team and crushed the 1st wave with &lt;3000 cases 27 deaths. delta is tougher but still only 5000 cases, 48 deaths and now 85% fully vaxt. if the world'd done thst, it wouldn't have been that good, but way better than it was.	1
1464337840431587328	@qstnvrythng_ afaik, it produces a negative spike amplification, but other typical genes used for the delta still come up positive.	1

1464338697487192070	delta and omicron emerged in india and south africa. and while india, despite being nowhere near as well-funded as the west, has almost unparalleled vaccine manufacturing capacity, south africa doesn't.  #vaccineequity	1
1464338634828566534	@scottgottliebmd so…what i take from that is that florida would be an excellent breeding ground for omicron, since we’ve been low after delta swept through? #deathsantis	1
1464338614268137474	so let’s sum it up: you have a variant with at least twice of delta’s transmissibility, plus potentially near-complete antibody escape. and our only response is banning flights from sa? i’m getting strong feb. 2020 vibes with this one. #omicron #b11259	1
1464338302526373893	@bottlebrush77 like delta… which still has 50% approx long covid for double vax at 28 days compared to unvaccinated… but worse. say post triple vax and  higher percentage and for longer… like 200% at 1 year.	1

1464338048167071745	@pv1004 you think maybe the appearance of a new variant will motivate some of them? one can only hope. i *think* more people got vaccinated after delta started making the rounds.	1
1464338013849374722	@kelticlass60 @frackhazreveal we need time to ascertain how well it competes with delta and i'm glad the plan is to shut down travel while we do so.  no one will ever know if it was their life or someone else's that was saved by this move, but it is absolutely saving a significant number of lives.	1

1464335453767847941	@guygrossman yes! plus as seen with delta, it introduces yet another wiggle-room for those opposing vaccines to say “what’s the point, it won’t be effective against the new variant anyway”.   new variants will come out all the time. creating such chaos is costly both socially &amp; economically	1
1464335383169273864	@levanderhart as another example of this: given the reporting around it, i had the feeling that delta hit kids way harder than previous variants, and that it was something to be concerned about.  turns out the kids numbers have been roughly constant throughout. they're relatively very safe.	1
1464335379490873344	odd, matt hancock said exactly the same last year. yes, delta became the dominant variant detected in the uk but that hasn't changed the presentation of the disease. i haven't looked at the data for the new variant but i'm somehow sceptical about the gov's claims	1

1464373152457318408	@drneilstone even if it's just less virulent than delta, that'd be a bit of a relief.  who knows, but fwiw, omicron doesn't have the same mutation mentioned here.   https://t.co/n1cgwijy4c	0
1464551152285106177	@africafactszone yeah, countries stopped flights from india too because of the delta variant but it's still managed to go everywhere. this is just a front by governments to look like they are doing something	0
1464301145740828673	@erictopol did you say 'only'? delta alone caused so much havoc.	0
1464551172669427712	delta, b1something, omicron, ...let's face it, we are just never handling all that shit with our ongoing approach.	0
1464207175241326596	we have a #nuvariant , called #b11529, and is supposed to be 500x stronger than the delta variant? this will never end. it breaks my heart when i think of kids who still need to grow up. but, then i wonder, what life will be like in this hell hole, for them.	0
1464471178551123974	this has truly become hilarious! delta, mu, omnicron, r.1, alpha, beta, charlie, pi, gamma, iota, etc., etc., etc.	0
1464264118844669956	@yaneerbaryam @yaneerbaryam is it corret that nu has 3x trasmissibility then delta variant? did you mean that ? from an r0 6-8 (based on delta) we should have it around 18-24 r0 of south african variant? more then measles ? with that mortality ?	0
1464286073111171072	@profjnmoyo after the mess of the delta variant and waiting to long, they have responded with vigour.  was it about racism no, is it an overreaction,  time will tell. debate in sa is are they a little to forthcoming compared to other countries.	0
1464183911391637505	@hugh_davison @marcel__za i'm not sure i follow. the vaccine was developed to address the only variant at the time: alpha. expecting it to be able to handle any and all variations seems a bit odd to me. the fact that it provided pretty good resistance to delta was actually pretty good.	0
1464614349138497537	@sajidjavid @ukhsa what will you do? act too late once again, as you did on delta variant of concern? there should be an immediate circuit breaker lockdown lasting a minimum of four weeks. look to china for how to deal with these ghastly variants of concern. #toryshambles	0
1464020081252339734	@chamisageorge @drericding the old strains are still out there, so yeah, there is a valid reason to vaccinate people.  and even against delta they provide a fair amount of protection.  the anti-vax’ers are going to hate to hear this, but we will be needing ongoing booster for new strains for a while.	0
1464641826435051529	@firearmsretro so like in clear and present danger and delta force 2	0
1464431131986739210	@asoftstar wait. i thought we were still on delta!?	0
1464262654307053569	a colleague points out that b.1.1.529 (nu) has p681h, not p681r, like delta, so it might not be as fit in term of transmission as delta. it might not overtake delta in areas of high delta transmission (like some areas of the us currently. we must keep an eye on it, of course!	0
1464553675964272645	@bookersparticus @baddaddee didn't fall for vid 19, delta v. this one is make believe too.	0
1464508052132880385	@eyevan808 @laura_7771 regardless of whether the virus is natural or being unleashed deliberately, the fact is that there is a plague.  so how will we, using our free will, respond to the omicron virus which is a covid/hiv hybrid.  very dangerous if it spreads like the delta did.  what are our options?	0
1464645946676060160	@ihearthestia i missed everything after delta!	0

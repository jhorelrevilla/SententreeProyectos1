	different and better.i have owned both kindle 1 and kindle 2, so i'm already committed to the basic idea: e-ink reading in a slim form factor with excellent connectivity to a large selection of books and subscriptions.	1
	i have come to rely on my kindle experience, and it has seriously enhanced my reading.	1
	the dx was not an obvious upgrade for me, but two features put me over the edge: the larger screen, and the native pdf reader.	1
	i now have the dx in my hands, and can report pros, cons, and neutrals: pros: -- the larger screen is a definite plus.	1
	i use the larger type size on my kindle 2 (older eyes), and at this type size i get far more text per page on the dx.	1
	this makes the whole reading experience more book-like (and should be a boon to people who buy large-print books.)	1
	-- the screen is also sharper and crisper than my kindle 2 in a side-by-side comparison: the text is darker, and the contrast is much better, making for better visibility overall.	1
	-- on a side note, the larger screen also makes it possible to read poetry on the kindle, even at large type sizes.	1
	on earlier kindles, the smaller screen cut off lines, so that you would lose the sense of when the poet ended the line.	1
	on the dx, you can see the whole line exactly as the poet meant it, with the cut-off in the right spot.	1
	-- the pdf reader works as advertised, and is extremely convenient.	1
	pdf documents appear on the dx exactly as they do on a computer screen.	1
	moreover, you can drag and drop your documents directly to the device using the usb cable (or use the for-a-fee email if you absolutely must.)	1
	the only downside: at least for the documents that i've used so far, i cannot adjust the type size as i can with native kindle documents.	1
	-- screen rotation also works as advertised: it operates as a mild zoom on both graphics and text and offsets slightly the downside of not being able to adjust the typesize on pdf documents.	1
	one nice design touch: the four-way navigation stick introduced on the kindle 2 is rotation-sensitive, and will move as expected relative to the screen rotation.	1
	-- more of the device space is devoted to the screen, while the white plastic border around the screen seems to have shrunk, both in general and compared to the proportion of screen to plastic on the kindle 2. i like this (but see below about the keyboard).	1
	-- storage: i like the increase in storage space, and don't mind the lack of an external storage card.	1
	i can see some people having trouble with this, but only those folks who either a) must regularly carry around pdf documents totalling more than 3.5 gb of space or b) must have nearly 3500 books regularly at their fingertips.	1
	i fall in neither category.	1
	cons: -- price: it's expensive, as you can tell pretty quickly.	1
	if you value the larger size, and the native pdf reader, these features may justify the roughly 30% premium you pay for the dx over the kindle 2. in truth, the dx should cost more than the kindle 2, and a 30% premium isn't unreasonable.	1
	but, for my money, amazon should drop the price on the kindle 2 to $300 or so, and charge $400 or a little less for the dx.	1
	still, i bought it, and will keep it at this price.	1
	-- one-sided navigation buttons: all of the buttons are now on the right side, and none are on the left.	1
	i'm a righty, so i shouldn't complain, but i found myself using both sides on the kindle 2. lefties have reason to complain, i think.	1
	-- one-handed handling: i often read while i walk, with my kindle in one hand, and something else in my other.	1
	because of the button layout, this will be more difficult on the dx.	1
	-- metal backing: i miss the tacky rubberized backing on my kindle 1. when i placed my kindle 1 on an inclined surface, it stayed in place.	1
	not so my kindle 2 and now my dx.	1
	this is not a complaint specific to the dx, but it's still there.	1
	neutrals (i.e.	1
	things worth noting): -- weight: the dx is heavier, noticeably so.	1
	this is only an issue if, like me, you regularly use the kindle with one hand .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	and even so, it's still doable.	1
	-- keyboard: the keyboard has 4 rows, and not 5: the top row of numbers from the kindle 1 and 2 has been merged into the top qwerty row, so that numbers are now only accessible with an alt-key combination.	1
	the keys are vertically thinner too, so that the whole keyboard is no more than 1' tall (compared to over an 1.5' on the kindle 2).	1
	at the same time, the keys themselves are a bit easier to press, a bit more protruding than on the kindle 2. for someone with big fingers (like me), this will be a slightly harder keyboard to use, but only slightly.	1
	that's all i can see.	1
	overall, the pluses outweigh the minuses for me, and i'm satisfied with my purchase.	1
	i can now think of using my dx for work documents on a regular basis, because of the pdf reader.	1
	the screen size and screen rotation make the overall reading experience more immersive.	1
	overall, the dx feels more like text and less like device and comes closer to the stated goal of the kindle: for the device to disappear, leaving only the joy of reading.       	1
	dx not quite all that.i owned the k1 and then the k2 and love them both, so i was really looking forward to the dx.	1
	my plan was to use the dx at home, and keep my k2 for carrying all over creation with me.	1
	it wasn't long, though, after my dx arrived the day before yesterday before disappointment set in.	1
	don't get me wrong, there is a lot to like about the dx: 1) pictures are awesome on it, if the publisher formats them properly.	1
	2) those who complain about darkness of text on their k2 (a problem i've never had, btw) will be thrilled by the dx's very dark text.	1
	3) the ability to rotate the screen is great.	1
	gives you a closer look at things like maps and charts.	1
	4) the browser is a bit faster than on the k1 or k2, though that isn't saying much--it is still very clunky to use.	1
	5) but web pages look pretty good on the dx.	1
	6) it holds 3500 books.	1
	but.....the dx just isn't all that.	1
	it has drawbacks that are really making me consider sending it back before my 30 days are up: 1) first and foremost, while it is true that it natively reads pdfs, it is really only a pdf *viewer*.	1
	you can't change the font size on pdfs, links will not function on them, and the ability to magnify pictures doesn't work on them either.	1
	so you better have large fonts on your pdf before you load it.	1
	looking at the pdf in horizontal mode helps a bit, but not by much.	1
	2) the dx is too big to hold comfortably.	1
	it's not really all that heavy, but it is top heavy and you feel a pull on your hands.	1
	and that pull is really evident if you try to use the keyboard while holding it--you practically have to lay the dx down flat, it becomes so difficult to type.	1
	3) they merged the number keys with the qwerty keys (losing a line of keys).	1
	what development genius thought it would be helpful and an 'improvement' to have to press the alt key every time you wanted to type a number?!?	1
	4) before my dx came, i really didn't think this would bother me at all, but i have to say: i really hate the fact that the 'next page' button is only on one side.	1
	i mostly use the left hand button.	1
	and yes, with the dx's rotation ability you can turn it upside down, placing the 'next page' button on the left side.... however, when you do this, the button is so high up that you have to slide your hand (not your thumb, your whole hand) up in order to turn the page.	1
	may sound nit-picky, but it is truly a pita to break off reading to do it.	1
	not only that, but having the keyboard at the top makes it even more top-heavy than when it is right side up!	1
	5) when you rotate the dx so that it is horizontal, the 'next page' button is either at the bottom or the top--in either case you can't just flick your thumb and change the page.	1
	again, a pita.	1
	6)  if you leave the rotation feature on 'auto' when you are not using your dx it drains your battery, so you must remember to turn the feature off when you stop reading.	1
	7) still no folders.	1
	an organization nightmare three times bigger than that of the k2 (which itself had increased the same problem on the k1):  the possibility of storing 3500 books but only being able to sort them by author, title, and 'most recent first.'	1
	i will be fiercely debating with myself in the next week or so, on whether i really want to keep the dx.	1
	it is so disappointing.	1
	it has the potential of being a really great e-reader...but as it stands now, it isn't.	1
	it's ok.  but for $489, it should be a lot more than merely ok.	1
	sorry sony prs-505... i'm moving on.	1
	perspective from a biomedical researcher.i don't generally write reviews, but i hope this one will be useful for other scientists who are contemplating a kindle dx.	1
	my use for the dx will be different from most of the users who have posted reviews.	1
	i maintain a library of nearly 4,000 pdf manuscripts/grants/documents.	1
	i probably have minimal use for ebooks from the kindle store.	1
	the number of pdfs is constantly growing as new research manuscripts are published (and downloaded to my computer).	1
	my principle reasons for purchasing a dx were to: 1) carry the electronic equivalent of binders of pdfs with me when traveling.	1
	an ipod for pdfs.	1
	this is a metaphor that works for the way that i view an ereader, though it probably doesn't apply equally well to everyone.	1
	2) have an easier way to read papers when traveling.	1
	easier means not worrying about battery life, unfurling a laptop in a cramped airplane, or carrying a bag full of papers.	1
	3) reduce eye strain from staring at a computer screen by moving serious reading from the laptop screen to the dx.	1
	from my preliminary use, i think the dx is a qualified success.	1
	text in manuscripts looks great.	1
	figures from manuscripts do not render well in portrait mode if there is a lot of detail; switching to landscape mode helps substantially.	1
	zoom into individual images/sections of pdfs would be welcome.	1
	navigating large numbers of pdfs from the home screen is currently clumsy.	1
	lack of directory support to organize large numbers of files is an issue.	1
	i've read about users using complex naming conventions to use 'search' as an indirect way to find files.	1
	renaming hundreds (or thousands) of files to make them easier to find is not a great solution.	1
	i suspect this will improve in time, either through a firmware update to this device or in the next generation of hardware.	1
	i'm also hoping against hope that one or more of the reference manager software providers (bookends, i'm looking at you) realizes that their software is to the kindle as itunes is to the ipod.	1
	if i could manage the content of my kindle through a reference manager, i would be thrilled.	1
	the idea of downloading a paper and syncing it in one step to the kindle to take with me is really appealing.	1
	this wouldn't completely overcome the problem with a flat file hierarchy once the papers are on the kindle, but it would help organize getting content onto and off the device.	1
	the biggest surprise to me is the functionality of the web browser.	1
	yes, it is pokey to render pages.	1
	no, i wouldn't want to use it to web surf.	1
	but if i had a destination web site that is heavy on content, i think reading on the kindle will be vastly superior to reading on the iphone or other mobile/tablet devices.	1
	i do doubt, however, that wireless data access will remain free on the kindle long-term.	1
	i can't imagine how amazon will be able to continue subsidizing the data costs.	1
	i think that this is a feature that should be enjoyed while it lasts, but i wouldn't be surprised if it goes away at some point in the future.	1
	though it adds another $50 to the cost, i think the matching case is attractive, functional, and creates an easy-to-carry package.	1
	so is it worth the high cost?	1
	i don't think i (or anyone) can really evaluate that until determining how well it integrates into daily work habits.	1
	i suspect that i will get heavy use out of it, but then i read a ton of pdfs.	1
	i do hope that the pdf support for dictionary lookup, highlighting, and annotation improves, but i base my review on what the product does - not what i would like it to do.	1
	hope this helps other heavy pdf users!      	1
	kindle dx - amazon's apathy and greed at work.first, let me say that i purchased and use my kindle dx daily.	1
	i thought about how to accurately write this review for some time now.	1
	when it gets right down to it, all ereaders on the market - and the flood now hitting the market - use the same e-ink panels made by the same company, generally have the same features as far as reading an actual book, etc.	1
	when this was a niche product in a market with no real competition than the product would get a much higher rating.	1
	however, it is now a market with many choices.	1
	the only way to be fair about writing a review is to assume that there are some basic functions that must exist (wireless access, reader screen quality, basic zoom/bookmark features, etc.)	1
	that all e-readers today have.	1
	the review should be what is unique about the kindle dx and review those features.	1
	if you just want to download a book and read it on an e-ink panel than every single e-reader on the market today will work fine.	1
	to that end, when looking at what makes the dx unique, i have to honestly say that i would not purchase this reader again - there are better options out there with several more just announced.	1
	after careful consideration, it becomes clear that amazon just felt that they could get away with a sub-par device based on their name and position in the market.	1
	1) pdf issues: this is a larger format reader, presumably for the purpose of reading standard sized documents (8.5' by 11').	1
	it is also being marketed heavily to students.	1
	both of these demand native full pdf support.	1
	while the kindle dx does render pdf's, it does so in an extremely crippled way.	1
	while i am well versed with the fact that some pdf's are rendered as images and the document itself does not contain links or text, most do.	1
	despite that fact the kindle does not allow you to change font size, add bookmarks, highlight text, use the dictionary feature, zoom in, use any links (i.e., the table of contents), etc.	1
	in other words, it presents that pages as pictures and provides absolutely zero 'digital control' over the documents - the very features that someone would want to use an electronic reader instead of a hardcopy for.	1
	i purchased this device as an engineer because i have hundreds of pdf's (manuals, client systems documentation, etc.).	1
	i have found that i am completely unable to use it for the reason i purchased it for.	1
	other readers treat pdf's as any other document allowing all the same e-reader functions and there is no reason - short of not wanting to pay adobe a license fee - that the kindle does not have this same functionality.	1
	2) file formats:  while the kindle dx does support several file formats, amazon is one of the last holdouts to insist on providing content in a drm protected proprietary format.	1
	they also do not read many industry standard formats.	1
	chm and lit are two of the huge formats that come to mind.	1
	many publishers - especially of technology books - release in chm format, essentially a slightly marked up html derivative that should be easy to render.	1
	mobi and others come to mind as well - with over 1,000,000 public domain titles available from many web sites in these other formats.	1
	yes, i understand protecting content - but amazon has gone overboard in trying to lock down the kindle to only offer 'all the features' on their proprietary format.	1
	this locks you in to buying ebooks from the kindle store.	1
	i understand the financial drive to do that - but most of us have documents that we have created, or content we have previously purchased for other platforms and have rights to, that we would like to read on the kindle.	1
	devices that restrict access to their own formats are generally given away or sold for a very low cost, with the understanding that the profit will be made on content (think about some of the original movie on demand set-top devices).	1
	amazon is selling this as a standalone device, and needs to not intentionally cripple it.	1
	and yes, there are tools to convert file type - which usually result in formatting issues and the burden should be placed on the end user.	1
	3) file system flaws:  amazon advertises the ability to hold 3,500+ books/documents (a huge exaggerating in and of itself).	1
	even if it held 350 titles, the file system has a huge problem.	1
	there are no ways to create any type of folder structure.	1
	you have to go to a single large flat listing of the documents on the reader and hit next page over and over - a painfully slow process in and of itself - and hope do don't miss the title you were looking for and have to start over.	1
	yes, the titles do start in alphabetical order, but they change based on most recently read being moved to the top.	1
	it is a ridiculous and unrealistic expectation to put more than a couple dozen documents on a device without any way to organize them into folders.	1
	the official amazon reply:  you can add tags and search by tags.	1
	yep, you can - and if you want to take the couple weeks it would take to add tags to a couple thousand pdf's then you have far more free time than i do.	1
	the kindle was purchased to save time - not to use my entire annual vacation time to organize it.	1
	4) no card reader:  for some unknown reason, amazon decided to not include any type of card reader.	1
	the memory can hold a large number of books - but pdf's can get to be 100mb or more if they are heavily diagrammed.	1
	the memory cannot be upgraded, so there should be some method to pop in a memory card.	1
	all of my cells phones have had this feature...and my $500 kindle dx does not?	1
	5) ergonomics:  i admit that the e-reader market is emerging so there has not been a large pool of users to pull opinions from.	1
	that said, it seems that the kindle dx made it through the art department and skipped the usability testing department.	1
	while it looks great and each to carry, the 5-way joystick thing, the lack of next/previous page buttons on both sides (that existed on previous models) and the absolute worst keyboard i have ever touched do not help the device.	1
	again - being marketed to students and professionals - just look at the official page on the amazon site.	1
	what is on the screen on the largest image there?	1
	it is a power plant diagram - not a page from a nyt best seller list.	1
	there should be a way to quickly type notes on things.	1
	there is no possible way a student could sit in a lecture and flip through pages and be able to type in notes and keep up with the class on this thing - completely unrealistic.	1
	6) no desktop application: while amazon advertises that no computer is required, they leave out the fact that even if you had one there isn't really anything you could do with it.	1
	there should be some application similar to apple's itunes that will auto convert file formats and allow organization of files and folders (if they existed), allow backup in case the device is lost/stolen/damaged and needs to be replaced, etc.	1
	this is especially true for students that would desire a full sized keyboard to add notes to documents/books and sync with the kindle.	1
	bottom line: the kindle dx is an absolutely great e-reader for someone that wants to simply read books, is comfortable buying only kindle content and just desires a larger screen.	1
	this is what i am now using it for.	1
	to this end it works great.	1
	if this is your only expectation - then get out the credit card.	1
	if you have fantasies of using it to actually read pdf's with any functionality, store a large number of documents, use it in a classroom setting, etc.	1
	then get a different e-reader and sacrifice battery life and get a tablet or laptop and wait for the next generation.	1
	do not buy this product!!	1
	amazon will deny warranty when unit defective!	1
	!.my kindle dx shipped july 30.  i really liked it until today.	1
	there is a white out on about 1/12 of screen so you cannot read many words on the page and the text is running veritical and horizontal at the same time.	1
	the product has not been dropped or otherwise damaged during use.	1
	when i called amazon kindle support they said they had never heard of problem, even though i told them i found in a few seconds on the web.	1
	they asked me to reset, which i did, but problem persisted.	1
	i was then told that the problem was not covered by warranty!!!!!!!!!!!	1
	i asked how could they know that without looking at device and they said it was not on known list of manufacturer defects.	1
	they told me to not even bother sending it in for warranty service but if i wanted a new one, i could pay them $250.00!!	1
	i spoke to 2 supervisors at the washington call center who gave me the same line.	1
	amazon is not standng behind this product, and this is the worst example of poor customer service i have encountered.	1
	i asked them how could they make a technical diagnosis over phone and they had no good answer, just kept repeating that it was not a covered defect.	1
	i asked them why they would not just say 'send it in and we will take a look at it', and they said it was a waste of time because it was not covered (even though they were 3000 miles away from unit and had not seen it)  they wiggled when i demanded a written explanantion of denial of warranty service ( which to me is breach of contract.	1
	do not buy this product.	1
	amazon should be ashamed of itself.	1
	they have lost a valuable and up to now loyal customer.      	1
	from a first time kindle buyer: good, but not perfect.first off, i am a first time kindle buyer, so this review will be more geared to those buyers thinking of entering into the kindle market, not a comparison of past editions.	1
	my first impression of the kindle dx was that it was actually very small compared to what i expected.	1
	the entire device is slightly smaller (in height and width) than a piece of paper, with the screen taking up approximately 85-90% of the front.	1
	this was actually a nice surprise, since i wanted something very portable, but good for magazines/research articles.	1
	after seeing the size of the dx, i think a k2 would have been way too small for what i want.	1
	at the same time, the device is very hefty.	1
	picking it up, it becomes almost tiring to hold up in one hand for too long (another reason i think this one is better geared toward short articles instead of extended novel reading).	1
	it has a nice solid feel to it, but for some reason i was expecting it to be lighter.	1
	the kindle only takes a couple of seconds to power up and immediately goes to the last article you were reading.	1
	a row of buttons are positioned on the right, which let you go to the main home page, go to the next page of an article, previous page, bring up a menu, or go 'back'.	1
	there is also a small four-way joystick to navigate around (which also has the ability to be pressed for selections).	1
	the joystick is very sensitive and easy to navigate with, although not overly sensitive that you hit things by mistake (at least very often - it has happened a couple of times so far).	1
	for those in the market for an ereader and can't decide between the kindle and another device, i can tell you what made me go toward the kindle: whispernet.	1
	it is a free, no subscription based service that comes on all kindles.	1
	you get free access to the internet anywhere sprint reception can be found.	1
	you can purchase books/magazines/newspapers anywhere, and have them in less than 60 seconds.	1
	you can access the web, check your web-based email, look up directions, find weather reports, movie times, etc.	1
	although the kindle terms say that normal web browsing might result in extra charges, my assumption is that this clause will just cover amazon if they choose to charge for web in the future.	1
	as of right now, everything is free.	1
	the web browser is very rudimentary and does not show pages very well.	1
	even most pages designed for mobile phones showed up badly for me, although some were okay.	1
	the browser is very slow, but could really come in handy if some information was needed and no internet was available.	1
	i have tried several blogs and magazines, as well as the native pdf viewer and all seem to produce well formatted articles with crisp, clear pictures.	1
	lighter pictures tend to show up better as darker pictures blur together if they do not have enough contrasting elements.	1
	the one problem i have noticed with the pdf viewer is that some text/elements can end up being very small and hard to see.	1
	the pdf viewer is stuck on one size, which is slightly smaller than most pdf's are intended to be viewed at.	1
	there is no way to increase font size, and the only way to zoom is by rotating the display.	1
	this zooms in on the top or bottom half of the screen.	1
	rotating to a landscape display actually helps that problem a great deal, but some sort of zoom feature would have been nice.	1
	you can search in pdf documents or go to certain pages, but it is impossible to annotate as the kindle lets you do in normal document files.	1
	pdf documents can be sent to the kindle dx via usb cable or through a special email that is set up for the device.	1
	however, documents that are sent via email are charged a small fee (i was charged $0.45 for a pdf slightly larger than 2mb - i will use the usb cable from now on unless it's absolutely necessary to use email).	1
	blogs i have subscribed to have continuously updated over the time i've had the dx... it is nice to have a constant stream of info to read even when not in the position to surf the web.	1
	most blogs and magazines are subscription based with costs ranging from free to $1.99 or more for the more popular ones.	1
	this fact turns many people off since blogs can be found free on the net, but the convenience of having them constantly updated with no internet connection required and brought to you in an easy to read format makes them somewhat worth it in my opinion.	1
	having read through some and watched constant updates while writing this review, i think i will be more likely to keep the blog subscriptions even more than the magazines subscriptions.	1
	most blogs and magazines give you a 14-day trial to see how well you like them before committing to a purchase.	1
	they can be organized into separate articles/sections, and are easy to navigate.	1
	there is a text-to-speech function that can be used in most books (random house published books excluded because of a lawsuit brought against amazon).	1
	the sound of it seems a little old fashioned with an extremely computer-sounding voice, but it is a nice addition.	1
	you can also play mp3's, but don't expect extremely high-quality sound.	1
	the kindle dx has a earphone jack on the top of the device, or small speakers on the bottom of the device for these funtctions.	1
	a keyboard is present at the bottom of the device.	1
	it has a qwerty format, but with the numbers located on the top row of letters (a shift button selects them).	1
	it is fairly easy to type on in my opinion, but takes a little getting used to.	1
	the buttons are small, rounded and don't take much to push.	1
	for this reason, it is difficult to tell if you hit the button acurately or not, and often times you find you hit wrong keys by accident.	1
	the kindle actually tends to be a bit wide to easily type if you have small hands like me.	1
	larger hands should do fine.	1
	as for the screen, the e-ink is easy to read, easy on the eyes, and it is crisp and has a nice resolution.	1
	highly detailed pictures showed up nicely as long as they weren't too dark.	1
	the only complaint i would have about the screen is that it is very reflective.	1
	i need to make sure i'm not around any bright lights before reading.	1
	otherwise, the glare interferes.	1
	should you buy the dx?	1
	: well, i think that comes down to what you want to read.	1
	the dx is a nice reader (although expensive!).	1
	it is probably the perfect size for reading magazine articles, journal articles, and newspapers.	1
	the articles come out as being crisp and easy to read, and having them constantly delivered to you is great.	1
	i think the device might be a little on the heavy/large side for continous reading of books, so for that, i would probably go with the kindle 2 instead.	1
	for textbooks, i think the verdict is still out.	1
	being able to flip through the pages of textbooks and quickly find information still isn't completely replicated by the kindle.	1
	however, the search features of the kindle could prove to be invaluable in studying, and there's no doubt the kindle helps in areas of portability.	1
	the dx replicates figures and images nicely, but in some textbooks, color is vital.	1
	that could be the downfall of the dx when it comes to textbooks.	1
	cons/for future kindles: there's quite a few things that prevent the dx from being perfect, but maybe they can be added into future editions.	1
	first and foremost: folders/organization!	1
	right now, all articles/blogs/newspapers/books get clumped together in one big menu.	1
	why is there no way to organize these and place them in categories?	1
	this would be a huge improvement and would take very little effort.	1
	also: color.	1
	as i just mentioned above, color is a huge part of many textbooks, articles, etc.	1
	as soon as the technology is ready, a color kindle will be a huge improvement.	1
	a memory card slot was included in the first kindle; however it was removed in the second and dx.	1
	this needs to be added back.	1
	especially for those of us with large pdf libraries, we need the extra memory slot.	1
	not to expand the memory so much as to just give us a portable way of getting articles onto the kindle.	1
	as of right now, you can be charged to have articles sent to the kindle, or we can be near a computer.	1
	why not add the memory card slot back and give us one more option?	1
	a better web browser, some sort of side-lighting for nighttime reading, touchscreen, thinner, and lighter are other suggestions i can think of to strive for.	1
	update: so, after using the dx for a while now, i have come to absolutely love it.	1
	unfortunately, so has my girlfriend, so i don't get to see it much anymore.	1
	a few small things have come to annoy me though, so i would like to point those out.	1
	first, the screen rotation is becoming more and more annoying.	1
	i find the screen rotating on me many times when i don't want it to.	1
	slightly changing the position of the device suddenly leads to the screen being rotated, and then it takes another few seconds of shifting it around to get it back the way you want.	1
	there should be a way to turn screen rotation off if you know you won't want it bothering you for a while.	1
	a simple setting could then be turned on again for normal use.	1
	(update: apparently, you can disable the auto-rotation.	1
	user a.nichols wrote in the comments: 'push the button with the aa (to change font size) and you'll find the option to set change screen rotation from auto (default) to portrait.	1
	i found the screen rotation to be annoying also when reading, it's easy to accidentally change the angle.')	1
	another thing that has come to bother me is the screen lag.	1
	very often, it's as though the screen sticks after you push buttons.	1
	you push them again and again, and then the screen finally unsticks and you fly through 3-4 pages.	1
	it's difficult to tell if the device didn't register the button you pushed or if it's just running behind.	1
	unfortunately, this has resulted in my purchasing a book that i didn't mean to (amazon was nice enough to remove the charge though).	1
	usually you get a 'would you like to cancel your order?'	1
	immediately after purchasing on the kindle, but this time i guess i pushed too much and flew through that screen too.	1
	even with these small issues, i can't put my kindle down.	1
	it is the best money i have spent in a long time.  	1
	kindle dx first impressions from a former kindle 2 user.here are my first impressions of the kindle dx which i received earlier today.	1
	i've been using the kindle 2 for the past three months and have loved it.	1
	it has improved the way i read by making it easy to download and try books before purchasing them, and allowing me to carry a variety of reading material with me.	1
	i was disappointed with the way it handled pdf's, which is important to me, so i sold the kindle 2 and bought the dx.	1
	- the dx works like the kindle 2 in terms of keys, navigation, joystick etc., except all the navigation keys are on the right.- was concerned about lack of navigation on the left, but if you flip it 180 degrees, the display auto rotates and you can use your left hand.	1
	very slick.	1
	- the dx is heavier, but is still comfortable to hold and read.- the overall size of the dx is not as big as i expected from the pictures on the web.- the digital ink looks similar on both, but a little sharper on the dx.- the dx works much better for pdf's overall.	1
	the bigger screen really helps here.- a complex powerpoint i converted to pdf looks just like it does on my pc except in b&w.	1
	;- pdf's with columns work fine.	1
	i couldn't read them on the kindle 2.- if you have a pdf with multiple columns, the print may appear small on the dx, and you can't adjust fonts in pdfs.- newspapers are easier to read on the dx, especially pics and tables.- i downloaded a sample chapter of a textbook.	1
	i can see this working well for students.- the rotate feature is excellent on the dx; works as advertised.- the kindle 2 weighs less and is more portable.	1
	if reading only books, i'd probably prefer the kindle 2, given the lower price and size, and nav keys on both sides.	1
	regarding the price, while i'd love kindles to cost less, i think the price is reasonable.	1
	here's how i justified it.	1
	i assumed i could resell the dx in 2 years for 50% of its purchase price, or $245.	1
	(50% seems reasonable based on the experience of kindle 1).	1
	so my net cost is $245.	1
	the differentiating feature of the kindle is the built in wireless capability.	1
	not only is it elegant and integrated, it is also included in the purchase price.	1
	if unlimited wireless were priced separately, a reasonable price would be around $10/month.	1
	so effectively my out of pocket cost using the dx for 2 years is roughly equivalent to what the wireless would cost me if it was priced separately.	1
	both the dx and kindle 2 are good values.	1
	if you only read books, the kindle 2 is probably better.	1
	if you already own a kindle 2, and don't read pdf's, i recommend keeping your kindle 2.  if you read a lot of pdf's or newspapers, or you like to read with large fonts, you'll be happier with the dx.	1
	for my needs, i like the dx more.	1
	rushed implementation mars a nice reader.	1
	display doesn't work?	1
	amazon blames the customer..update 8/21/09:though the commenter's advice to contact mr. cuomo was tempting, i instead decided to write a very polite letter to amazon.	1
	they came to their senses and promptly sent me a replacement unit.	1
	i would like to thank jennifer b. from amazon for resolving this issue.	1
	my original review remains below although i regret the bit about the amazon reps getting zero stars.	1
	i suppose on average they deserve 2.5.   a few days after i received my kindle dx, i placed it in a protective case (purchased from amazon), in a bag, in the trunk of my car.	1
	when i took it out, the display was not working.	1
	there were strange patterns of lines on the display, although the screen showed no signs of physical damage.	1
	naturally, i called amazon to arrange for a replacement or repair.	1
	as soon as i began talking to the rep, i immediately got the feeling that they were trying to blame me for the issue.	1
	i assured her that i treated my kindle with care, even going to the trouble of using a protective case.	1
	i sent a photo of the display and they informed me that the photo 'confirmed' that i had damaged the kindle.	1
	while i told them it was possible that the screen could have been physically damaged at some point, as i do not monitor it 24/7, it was highly unlikely to have happened in the trunk of my car.	1
	for all i know, the damage happened during shipping/before i received it, and it only manifested itself after a short period of time.	1
	i told them very nicely, but firmly, that i had done nothing to damage the kindle in the trunk of my car.	1
	they basically told me that it was my fault and there was nothing they could do.	1
	it clearly was not my fault; even if 'damage' happened while it was in my possession, it would only be because the kindle is so fragile that even in a highly protected environment it was damageable.	1
	and again, i highly doubt that this occurred in the first place.	1
	however, since i value my time and dislike arguments, i was willing to settle for less than a full refund/replacement.	1
	i told them that since a large portion of the purchase price goes to cover the wireless service, i simply requested a refund for a couple hundred dollars since i would obviously not be using the wireless service.	1
	this request was denied.	1
	instead, they offered me a $20 credit toward new books (which by the way has not shown up on my account yet).	1
	i have to say that, as a long time amazon customer, i am extremely disappointed.	1
	i have purchased hundreds (maybe thousands) of items from amazon and i do not recall having ever returned anything that was opened or removed from the box.	1
	i brought this to the supervisor's attention and pointed out that, based on my history, i am unlikely to be a customer who damages his items and then tries to transfer the loss to the seller.	1
	i also pointed out that i have done extremely good marketing for them by speaking highly of amazon at every opportunity, and would appreciate it if they would be willing to make an exception to their strict policy, which in my view clearly punishes some innocent parties to protect amazon from a few unscrupulous customers.	1
	i thought it would be clearly in their interest to work out some kind of reasonable repair/refund arrangement, but there was no sympathy of any kind from them.	1
	the lessons should be clear.	1
	(1) if your kindle stops working, whether it is your fault or not, be prepared for amazon to blame you.	1
	(2) if you ever plan to take the kindle more than 3 feet from your desk/bed, take your advice from the amazon rep's own words: the covers you purchase on amazon.com don't protect the screen from damage.	1
	(3) like many of you, i had never had a real conversation with amazon customer service (until this incident).	1
	i was very surprised with how unsympathetic they were to someone with such a long customer history.	1
	i can't even imagine how they treat their newer/smaller customers!	1
	i recommend against the purchase of the kindle dx unless a loss of $500 would be trivial to you.	1
	i give the kindle dx one star and i give the amazon reps zero.      	1
	not 'the answer' for academics and professionals.as a grad student who is tired of printing out scores of journal articles or straining my eyes (and sucking battery power) reading them on a conventional computer screen, i have been eagerly watching the evolution of e-book devices waiting for one that would meet the needs of academics and professionals who are constantly reading, highlighting, and annotating documents and books.	1
	because amazon has marketed the kindle dx as the e-reader for academics and professionals, highlighting its large screen and native pdf support, i finally thought that this was a product suitable for types like me and forked out the five hundred dollars for the dx.	1
	alas, upon receiving the kindle yesterday in the mail, it did not take long to realize that this machine is not the 'answer' that i had hoped it would be.	1
	the reason is simple: no highlighting or annotating pdfs, word documents, and other personal documents.	1
	it did not even occur to me to inquire, before purchasing the dx, whether highlighting and annotating pdfs and word docs was possible.	1
	after all, one can easily acquire free software that enables one to do this on a computer (e.g.	1
	skim for macs), and in the kindle dx press conference amazon made a big deal about bringing reality to paperless workplaces, putting an end to the routine of printing out document after document.	1
	well, surely one of the major reasons people print out documents is so that they can mark on them with underlinings, highlights, and notes.	1
	and given that one cannot do that for pdfs and other documents on a kindle dx, amazon's sales pitch is quite misleading: anyone who needs to interact with documents in the way typical of academics and professionals will still need to print out those documents (or make due on an eye-straining and power-consuming computer).	1
	not only is it impossible to add an annotation to a specific passage in a pdf or word document, one cannot add any annotations whatsoever, even at the page level (or document level, for that matter).	1
	clipping/highlighting support is also completely absent.	1
	this is frankly unacceptable for a product marketed as the kindle for students and professionals.	1
	as i'm sure other reviews here will attest, the kindle dx is in other respects a beautiful and wonderful machine.	1
	if you just want to read pdfs, and have no desire to annotate or highlight them, then this would be a very satisfying device.	1
	and if you only need to annotate and/or highlight books (and can find the books you need in the kindle store and can afford to buy them!	1
	), then the dx will be a wonderful piece of equipment to own.	1
	but if you are a typical student, academic or professional who needs to interact with your documents (and not just read them), and are looking for something that will replace the need to print documents or read them on your computer, the dx simply does not fit the bill.	1
	wait for the next product, or for amazon to update their firmware with respectable support for pdfs and other document types.	1
	i'll be mailing my kindle back to amazon tomorrow.       	1
	died after 7 weeks on vacation.	1
	do not buy this with a leather case!.do not buy this kindle and their 'accompanying' leather case!	1
	they encourage you to buy the leather cover for this (made by amazon specifically for this kindle)and do not tell you it will crack your kindle.	1
	i paid $489 for a kindle that is now completely cracked.	1
	when i called customer service they claimed it was 'user error' on how i was opening and closing the case.	1
	it is like a book, not hard to open.	1
	it is clearly not designed properly and they include no instructions or warnings with the cover saying this might happen.	1
	unfortunately i was not one of the 'lucky' ones who got theirs replaced like a few others have noted, apparently they are not doing this anymore which is unacceptable for a $489 piece of equipment to crack.	1
	very disappointing....      	1
	ok device, terrible warranty.i have had my kindle dx for about two months and am mostly pleased with it--it works well for reading, and the display is easy to read--but i wish it had better support for pdfs.	1
	yes, they display, but if you don't like the way it zooms, you can't do anything about it except rotate the device; you should be able to to some manual tweaking.	1
	additionally, you cannot make annotations on pdfs (i understand why you can't highlight, but there's no reason you shouldn't be able to make notes for a page as a whole).	1
	i was hoping to use this more for grad school, but i don't think students or professionals with a lot of pdfs to read will find this useful, unless they are formatted specifically with the kindle in mind.	1
	additionally, my screen has recently developed a defect.	1
	namely, i have horizontal and vertical lines, in addition to a portion of the display that is stuck black.	1
	i did not do anything unsual to my device like smash it or drop it, but amazon refuses to replace the kindle because they claim it is not covered under the 1-year limited warranty (even though, while i am not a lawyer, it certainly seems to be if you actually read it: 'we warrant the device against defects in materials and workmanship under ordinary consumer use for one year from the date of original retail purchase....').	1
	further, some people have had their kindles replaced (even when it is cleary their fault!	1
	), so it seems to be hit or miss depending on who you get on the other end of the phone.	1
	if you buy this device, i recommend treating it like a piece of glass: very carefully, always in a caseor sleeve, and do get the extended warranty--except you'd be better off buying a warranty from squaretrade at a much more reasonable price than amazon's.	1
	in the mean time, i have a $389 brick that amazon won't replace.	1
	you should not have to buy an extra warranty to have damage resulting from normal use and handling of the device be covered (and, depending on who at amazon you talk to, you apparently don't).	1
	but because of the sketchy 1-year warranty, i cannot recommend that anyone buy this device; amazon needs to stand by it better, with or without the extended 2-year warranty (although you'd be better off purchasing a similar third-party warranty for less).	1
	the device is ok (good, not great); the customer support with regard to warranty (they *were* good when i made an accidental purchase on the kindle) is terrible.      	1
	a week with the kindle dx.okay, not yet a complete week.	1
	it's only been five days.	1
	monday got off to a bang.	1
	my first experiments were very promising.	1
	i put several pdf files on the kindle dx to see if they would be readable.	1
	to my delight, the programmers were smart enough to use the media bounding box and not the page size to determine what to draw on screen.	1
	the page margins are redundant on the kindle.	1
	the device's plastic border serves as a margin.	1
	let's see what this puppy can do.	1
	i throw some latex generated pdfs on it.	1
	the older of these files use postscript type 3 embedded fonts.	1
	they use bit mapped fonts set designed for a specific device resolution--a 600 dpi printer.	1
	the kindle scales everything beautifully.	1
	nice.	1
	i put some papers from siggraph meetings on my kindle.	1
	these pdfs contain a lot of color graphics.	1
	it's the special interest group graphics of the acm after all.	1
	i don't expect much, but let's stress the system.	1
	even with only 16 grey levels, kindle manages to produce a reasonable representation of the figures.	1
	it kind of takes me back to days of viewing images on my old mac plus.	1
	the algorithms have been around for years.	1
	even given the low dynamic range of e-ink, they manage to do a pretty good job.	1
	the results are serviceable for the platform.	1
	no real complaints here.	1
	siggraph papers are double column and printed on paper that is bigger than the kindle dx.	1
	even just zooming on the media bounding box, the fonts are kind of small.	1
	tuesday.	1
	let's start moving journal articles over to the kindle.	1
	these are papers purchased from places like the journal of physical chemistry, etc..  hmm, double column articles with complex mathematics are a bit of a problem in portrait mode.	1
	by the time you put an exponent on a term in the numerator of a term in the denominator of an integral, the font size is getting pretty small.	1
	turn the kindle to enter landscape mode.	1
	everything rescales, and the math is readable again.	1
	but a complete page doesn't fit on screen.	1
	i expected that.	1
	just click the next page button.	1
	when the kindle is sideways, the buttons are in an awkward position.	1
	rats.	1
	furthermore, the article is two column.	1
	in landscape mode, you have to hit those buttons a lot.	1
	next page, next page, previous page, next page...zig-zagging my way through the text.	1
	i think i'll stick to portrait mode except when i need to really see the equations in detail.	1
	wednesday.	1
	my hobby is history.	1
	a few months back, i downloaded the complete set of scanned pdfs of the nuremburg trials.	1
	the national archives have them available for download.	1
	they are government documents so they aren't protected by copyright.	1
	they are no longer in print, and buying the full set from used book dealers would cost thousands of dollars.	1
	the full set of scanned documents is about 2 gigabytes of files.	1
	i only have 3.3 gigabytes of storage available.	1
	i probably don't want to take up all of my space with just these files.	1
	i put a few volumes on the kindle.	1
	the pages are rendered clearly.	1
	i can still search the ocr'ed text of the files.	1
	it's a shame there isn't sufficient room to put them all on my kindle.	1
	thursday.	1
	i need to replace the hard drive and add memory to my laptop.	1
	i download the pdf manual from the manufacturer to get instructions.	1
	success!	1
	the kindle is perfect for this job.	1
	laptop is disassembled while flipping through the pages of the manual.	1
	i didn't have to print out the instructions.	1
	uh-oh.	1
	suddenly realized that there is no password protection on the kindle.	1
	i have a few business documents on it which i'm going to have to remove.	1
	why can't i password protect this thing?	1
	it's so tempting to put business documents on it.	1
	i'll have to remember not to do that.	1
	if i lose my kindle, it could be a problem.	1
	trying to read my kindle in bed.	1
	i've got nearly a hundred pdf files on the kindle now.	1
	i've been cleaning out my filing cabinets of software manuals and printed copies of papers.	1
	it's starting to get cluttered.	1
	dragging files into folders organizes them on the kindle's disk, but the table of contents still only has one level.	1
	i have to flip through several pages of titles to find the article that i want.	1
	friday.	1
	why is this thing getting slow?	1
	turning the pages on some of my pdfs takes 30 or 40 seconds.	1
	uh-oh, some of these pages aren't being scaled correctly.	1
	the fonts are tiny.	1
	the text only partially fills the screen.	1
	this page rendered perfectly yesterday.	1
	what gives?	1
	i think they may have a memory leak.	1
	is there some way to make this thing reboot?	1
	simply putting it to sleep isn't going to solve the problem.	1
	beginning to get frustrated.	1
	some pages render correctly, others do not.	1
	performance is random and degrading.	1
	i think i'll write a review.	1
	my final review is mixed.	1
	a very promising device with several serious faults.      	1
	don't buy this kindle revised.update:  i got through to another tech person who reversed the first decision and has replaced my kindle--graciously and without blaming me.	1
	i am still a little concerned that the size is the culprit.	1
	this screen may just be too big.	1
	buy the additional coverage if you get one.	1
	i have to say, i loved this kindle with all my heart.	1
	i had gotten back to reading constantly.	1
	i couldn't get enough of it.	1
	but one day it suddenly was broken and tech said it was my fault and would replace it for a mere $350.	1
	he said i had to have dropped it or put something heavy on it.	1
	the thing is, i treated it as if it were my child.	1
	i had never dropped it, never placed anything on top of it.	1
	when not in use, it sat in a place of honor on my coffee table.	1
	i suspect this screen might be a little too big-- i have seen other reviews like mine and i think the glass inside this thing is too fragile.	1
	it is incredibly short-sighted of amazon to treat the early adopters of this technology in this way.	1
	do they realize how much content we were buying?	1
	it is unbelievable.      	1
	only ok for academic researchers w/ lots of pdfs..	1
	device cracks easily if you put in the cover provided by amzon.i got the kindle today, put it in the cover also provided by amazon, maybe opened it the wrong way and the device cracked.	1
	and amazon tells me that it is damaged due to misuse and will not take it back.	1
	sorry guys, this may be a good device but, the customer service is very very disappointing.        	1
	.pdf review.summaryi'm relatively happy.	1
	maybe b-.	1
	the kindle dx handles a wide variety of .pdf files fairly well, though there was little consistency between file type and available functions.	1
	the big issue is that there is zero consistency in how .pdf files are displayed.	1
	some use all available space in both landscape and portrait mode, eliminating all margins.	1
	this provides acceptable font sizes.	1
	in other cases the file leaves large margins, and thus small to tiny font size.	1
	very unpredictable.	1
	backgroundwe have owned two kindle 1s for over a year, use it for the 5 months a year when we're out of the us and have limited access to english language books.	1
	but much of the written material i have is in .pdf format, and while simple text converts to .txt format without problem, anything more complex is something between annoying and impossible: footnotes, multiple columns, illustrations/photos, and image files.	1
	so i purchased the dx solely for the ability to display .pdf files, and this review will only address .pdf functions.	1
	both the manual and customer service provide little guidance, which is odd since this feature is surely one of the main reasons for interest in the dx.	1
	i loaded up about 20 .pdf files.	1
	the first set were files originally created in .pdf format, and thus not image files: large text books heavy with foot and end notes, 2 photo and 2 manga books, newsletters and magazines with complex, multi-column formatting and illustrations and documents created in word and saved in .pdf.	1
	the second set were image files, meaning they were either scanned or 'printed' and saved as .pdf files.	1
	these consisted of everything from a scanned document to a poorly scanned receipt.	1
	now on to the various functions and how well they worked... 1. able to display most pdf files?that is a quote from the manual.	1
	what the heck does 'most' mean?	1
	don't know, but everything i loaded, including poorly scanned expense receipts were displayed, and easy to read (subject to the caveat that the print size might be very small).	1
	periodically i received a 'some elements on this page could not be displayed' message.	1
	i had an entire book of book cover designs, and none of the covers (which constituted half of the book) were viewable.	1
	but other books of illustrations and photos had none of this problem.	1
	all graphs, illustrations, photos, manga displayed very nicely, though the display is solely black and white.	1
	the lack of color isn't an issue for me, and the grey tones were fairly nuanced.	1
	2. changing type size: landscape view.the change type font feature is not available for .pdf files.	1
	the font size is instead automatically increased using 2 functions: cropping white margins (see paragraph 3, below) in portrait mode and expanding the width of the file by rotating the kindle 90 degrees to landscape mode.	1
	i created a template of font sizes in times new roman in a word document with 1 inch margins, printed it and then both saved the document as a .pdf file and printed the document as .pdf (thus an image file) .	1
	i then compared the font sizes between the printed document and both the .pdf created and .pdf image files.	1
	in portrait mode, 16 point type (again, with 1 inch borders that disappear), shows as 12 point type.	1
	12 point as 9.5.  in landscape, 16 shows up as 14, 12 as 10.5.   there was no difference in font size between the document created as .pdf and printed as .pdf image file.	1
	one thing to remember about landscape mode is that it divided the page into parts.	1
	if you have a multi-column document, you will need to advance to the next page to finish that one column, then go back a page to start the next column.	1
	i found the page turning considerably slower than with documents on the kindle 1.  also, it is a dummy division of pages.	1
	so if in landscape mode a screen is 60% of the page, then in the next page you will see 40% of the bottom of one page, some white space and then maybe 20% of the next page.	1
	that works (somewhat) for text, but not at all for illustrations.	1
	so you really are stuck viewing illustrations, comics, graphs, etc in portrait unless you luck out and the page is equally divisible by the landscape screen.	1
	sometimes it worked, other times it didn't.	1
	several long, complex books either took over 30 seconds to switch to landscape, or never switched.	1
	3. white margins of pdf files are automatically cropped.another quote from the manual.	1
	this is not necessarily true, particularly in landscape mode.	1
	i had some books that retained their margins in landscape, while others lost it and the print went right to the edge.	1
	i also had some files created as .pdf that retained their margins even in portrait.	1
	in one dictionary, the portrait mode showed print considerably larger than landscape.	1
	portrait went to the edge, landscape retained the margins and indented the entire page.	1
	4. moving around a document.easy.	1
	menu-go to page-alt and then the number.	1
	though why isn't it menu sensitive?	1
	why do i need to use alt- with the w/2 key in order to go to page 2?	1
	it takes 2 hands to do that.	1
	annoying.	1
	but on the major plus side, the go to function goes to the page number, not the number of the document!!!	1
	so if your book has a title page, table of contents, intro chapter with roman numerals, etc, and then page numbers, when you 'go to page 200' it takes you to the page with that number at the bottom.	1
	not the 200th page in the file.	1
	that means you can bookmark the table of contents, and then easily go to any page with simply the 'to go page' function.	1
	not surprisingly, this is not true with image files, where page 22 is the 22nd page of the file, regardless of what the page number on the actual page says.	1
	5.  you cannot add a note or highlight text.	1
	the manual correctly states this limitation.	1
	the function itself simply isn't available when you have a .pdf file.	1
	6. bookmarks.the bookmark function is available for all .pdf files.	1
	7. search.this is the one place in the manual where a distinction is made between different types of .pdf files.	1
	the search function is available for .pdf files, but... 'this [search] feature doesn't work in cases where a pdf document was created using image files.'	1
	not necessarily true.	1
	i was unable to use the search function on several created .pdf files, but had no trouble on some image files.	1
	that said, in general it is true that the search function works on .pdf files that are not image files.	1
	the search of a file only works if you have open a specific file.	1
	if you are doing a global search in all of the files on the kindle, the manual says 'for pdfs, kindle searches for the term in the metadata only.'	1
	i am not an expert on adding metadata into files, but i tried, and none of the data i added showed up in a search of .pdf items.	1
	8. text-to-speech and dictionary functions.neither is addressed in the manual, but these are not available for any .pdf files.	1
	conclusionwell, i finally get to view and read .pdf files on a kindle, and i'm very thankful.	1
	but after 2 hours of fiddling with this, my first thoughtis  that i need to buy a kindle-pdf set of glasses much stronger than what i normally use, so that i can enlarge type that is of inadequate size.	1
	there is little consistency between the type/size/complexity of a .pdf file and how it displays.	1
	true russian-roulette.	1
	so if you don't have a fairly high tolerance for small (or smallish) type size and variable use of an already diminished set of functions, then you shouldn't buy this kindle just for the ability to view .pdf files.	1
	but it is at least a step in the right direction.	1
	though an expensive step!	1
	even better than kindle 1 & 2.reading on the kindle dx is such a joy.	1
	i've been so happy with my first generation kindle 1, but the dx takes kindle reading to the next level.	1
	the amount of content that fits onto the screen is a vast improvement to the experience.	1
	and even better than the *quantity* of content is the *quality* of the content.	1
	the display on the dx is truly phenomenal.	1
	i write technical documents for a living.	1
	the product documentation that i write is full of images, diagrams, and rich formatting.	1
	i've tried loading my pdf documents onto my kindle 1, but they won't display.	1
	i couldn't believe my eyes when i loaded my pdfs onto the kindle dx.	1
	the formatting of the page displayed perfectly!!!	1
	zooming and rotating was simple.	1
	i read a lot of technical documents too.	1
	i've always been sorry that i couldn't read good technical books on my kindle 1 (the latest photoshop books, etc.)	1
	they look great on the dx though.	1
	with the dx, you can carry your whole reference library with you: dictionaries, reference manuals, the bible, ... i even have pdf versions of the shop manuals for our dirt bikes.	1
	i haven't loaded them onto the dx, but it sure would be easier to have them on one compact device than having five big fat books for the bikes.	1
	the kindle dx isn't cheap, but i imagine the price will come down eventually like it did with earlier kindle versions.	1
	it is an astounding device though--truly a game changing piece of equipment.	1
	think of how your tv viewing changed when you got your first tivo, how driving changed when you got a gps, how your phone changed when you got voicemail and caller id.	1
	that's how your reading will change when you get your fist kindle.      	1
	inconsistent.my initial impression of the kindle dx was great.	1
	out of the box it looks good, is easy to read and the downloading couldn't be easier.	1
	however, at the moment the range of available books is limited.	1
	the pr on the number of books is, i suspect, high as when i searched there were often multiple versions of books such as 20,000 leagues under the sea - a great book but more than one version.... also, after only three weeks my dx decided to go blank and remained so for two weeks before i was able to get it back online.	1
	overall, great concept but i would wait until it matures before recommending it to my friends.      	1
	too fragile.i just lost $500 because i was waiting for a decent cover i liked for it and did not pay enough attention to protecting the screen.i just got mine a few weeks ago, loaded some reading material and took a flight out of town, only to get tired of reading, so i put it in my purse and shoved it in the overhead compartment.	1
	it looks like the pressure of one of the suitcases that was later put on there pressed against my purse and thereby the screen, damaging it completely.	1
	the warranty does not cover negligence, and the replacement piece is $350.	1
	it's not worth the price.	1
	now i know it's not something you can take with you if you are an adventurous traveler.	1
	hiking or other activities that require you to pack your bags tightly.	1
	so my advice is that if you are going to spend that much money, go the extra step and get a cover that is sturdy to resist any outside poking at the screen.	1
	it's a cute little device, but not perfect yet.	1
	if the screen is shot they need to replace the whole thing.	1
	i think i'll just keep reading on my netbook which was the same size but with all the word processing i need, bigger memory, in color, and the size of self scanned pdf was truly adjustable to zoom.	1
	i like my aspire acer one much better.good luck to all of you who decide to spend the extra money.      	1
	some head-scratching design choices torpedo the dx.i am a kindle 2 owner and someone who uses e-readers for personal and professional purposes (i am an academic).	1
	i purchased the dx as soon as it was announced because of its ability to display pdfs in native format.	1
	well, after using the device for about a week, i sent it back.	1
	i won't rehash the reasons in detail (susan umpleby's review touches on many of the problem areas), but some merit further discussion.	1
	problems 1) size.	1
	the dx is too big to handle with one hand, but too small to display most academic journal articles in a size that is comfortable to read.	1
	putting the device into a landscape orientation only zooms about 20%, and it awkwardly divides the page in the process.	1
	in reality, the dx needs a larger display, roughly 8.5x11 inches would be perfect.	1
	instead, it's too hot/too cold.	1
	you've got a reader that cannot do the job of casual reading or professional reading well.	1
	2) keyboard position.	1
	this one is hugely frustrating.	1
	i actually love the kindle's experimental web capability, and have used it extensively on the kindle 2. i also type notes on my reading, so the keypad matters to me.	1
	but the geniuses who designed the dx's keyboard either did not use it, have fingers like a concert pianist, or perhaps possess a third hand.	1
	my hands are not small, yet due to the clustering of all the keys in the center (on the x-axis) of the device, when i hold the device on the sides i cannot reach all of the keys with my thumbs--and thumb-typing is what the kindle keypad is all about.	1
	a simple design choice--diving the keypad into two sections, once clustered on the left side, the other on the right, would solve this problem.	1
	instead, you have to release one hand  to reach certain keys.	1
	pitiful ergonomics.	1
	3) alt and shift keys only on one side.	1
	the shift key complaint pertains to the kindle 2, as well, but amazon has compounded it by combining the numeric keys with the top row of letters, requiring the use of the alt key whenever numbers are entered.	1
	the problem is, when you hold a portable device and type with your thumbs, the thumb that is holding the shift or alt key cannot be used to press a key that is on that side of the keyboard.	1
	for example, the shift key is on the left, so if i want to type a capital a, i have to hold the shift key with my left thumb, release my right hand and reach over and press the 'a' key with it.	1
	come on!	1
	just put another shift (and alt) key on the right, and the problem is solved.	1
	4) notes and markups in pdfs.	1
	i love the highlighting and notetaking features of the stand mobi/azw docs on the kindle.	1
	but what person reading a pdf does not want to take notes on it?	1
	i sure as hell don't read pdfs for pleasure, but the dx leaves you out of luck for note-taking.	1
	the lack of highlighting is perhaps understandable (you can't really do that too well with protected pdfs on a pc, either), but you can't even enter page-relevant notes with the dx.	1
	the best you can do is bookmark.	1
	ms. umpleby hit the nail on the head when she called the dx a pdf 'viewer', and not a great one at that.	1
	for academics or professional users looking for an electronic reader to handle pdfs, i strongly recommend waiting for another device (such as plastic logic's reader).	1
	if you don't own a kindle, stick with the kindle 2--it's comfortable to use, more portable, and there are decent workarounds for displaying pdfs.	1
	spend a little on a decent pdf converter (i like nuance's program, but there are other good choices), and you can display pdfs (though not the images, charts, and graphics in pdfs) quite well on the kindle 2, plus you will have the note-taking and highlighting missing from the native-pdf display.	1
	yes, the dx is faster than the 2 (although many pdfs take a looong time to display).	1
	yes, it can display images better.	1
	but for those marginal improvements, it is manifestly not worth the price or the hassle of using it.	1
	just a poorly designed device.      	1
	nice, but failed implementation on a number of fronts.well, i've spent a few days with the kindle dx now and feel like i've given it a good run through.	1
	since i've had a kindle since the first one, and engaged it thoroughly i'm familiar with the tech so i can give this a bit of a better shake than we've been seeing on most tech blogs, etc.	1
	on reading:this is, after all, its primary purpose.	1
	it does this very well.	1
	the screen is clear, the text is very readable.	1
	i was a bit worried about reading on a bigger screen but it is actually a better experience than the earlier kindles.	1
	books:books work the same way as previous kindles and most ebooks.	1
	it does a great job.	1
	periodicals:despite the new, bigger screen, we're still getting the old kindle media screen - we're not seeing the actual cover of the ny times or anything else like that.	1
	it works the same way, but bigger.	1
	pdfs:it gets a bit dodgy here.	1
	for the most part, it does a great job.	1
	90% of what i threw at it, it handled admirably.	1
	it cuts off the white edges pretty well (fails at this sometimes in landscape mode), and as long as the text you're looking at isn't too small you're generally in good shape.	1
	there are some drawbacks:-no table of contents.	1
	this is an enormous, enormous pain in the butt.	1
	i don't have the foggiest idea why the kindle does not have this very rudimentary and necessary feature for pdf viewing.	1
	in-text links also do not work, such as footnotes or internal tables of contents.-it can be slow.	1
	not always, but often it is.-metadata is... who knows?	1
	sometimes it is right, sometimes it is wrong.	1
	mostly it's some variation of wrong.-dictionary support doesn't seem to work in pdf texts - again - stupid and a problem.	1
	you also can't highlight, annotate, etc.	1
	this is vital - you cannot deal with pdf's in a meaningful way.	1
	the pdf support is a glorified picture viewer and while this is pretty functional on a number of levels, for something used for 'text books' this fails miserably.	1
	ergonomics:-it is lighter than i thought it'd be and not at all difficult to manage from that standpoint.	1
	the leather case does add some weight, but this is offset by also adding some protection.-i really, really dislike the absence of buttons on the left side and would strongly advocate for buttons on the top and maybe even bottom.	1
	there is no good way to handle the device in landscape mode.	1
	it is an intensely unpleasant way to read.-the keyboard is... well, quite frankly, it is the single worst keyboard i've ever used on a device and this includes the abomination that was my treo 600. the buttons are incredibly small, and because of the size of the device, actually using them is very difficult (as you are trying to hold the device and push buttons on the very edge of it).	1
	it is also spaced badly, so that you can't really use your thumbs and have to hen-peck the keys.	1
	this has, single handedly, pretty much removed any usefulness involving annotation.	1
	i also don't want to have to search (which combined with the lack of table of contents in pdfs this is even worse!)	1
	extras:-i never use the music function, so i can't speak to that.-the voice function is a bit... i found that the controls were often not very fast and usually somewhat unresponsive.	1
	once it gets going it is what you'd expect.-websites look much better than they did on the k2, and it seems to load a bit faster but generally it is still so slow that you'd not want to do much with it except look up the occasional thing.	1
	conclusion:i really like the device as a whole but some of the design was very bad.	1
	if i really didn't need a pdf viewer (and didn't hate reading on an lcd) i would probably return it and wait it out for a better product.	1
	i really loved my kindle 1 and kindle 2 and for what they did they did it perfectly (i'd give them both 5's) but what the kindle dx purports to do, it does badly.	1
	i'll be keeping it because of the pdf support, if lackluster, but i will not be suggesting it to others as i have the previous devices.[...]	1
	amended review ~ does amazon back up the fabulous product with fabulous service?	1
	hm..for my husband and myself, i bought two kindle dx's ($489 x 2).	1
	two covers emblazoned with the amazon logo ($50 x 2).	1
	two extended warranties ($109 x 2).	1
	two mighty bright clip-on lights ($20 x 2).	1
	everything arrived on june 30, 2009.  neither of us has owned an electronic reader before.	1
	we love our kindles, just love them ... so easy to use, we've had our noses in our kindles since they arrived.	1
	which is great because we've been traveling since we received them and love having the nytimes etc at our fingertips each morning as well as great books (yesterday i read 'the film club,' a memoir by david gilmour that fascinated and moved me deeply).	1
	however.	1
	the back-up service we've received doesn't match the quality of the reader itself.	1
	when they arrived, my husband slipped my kindle into its case with no problem at all.	1
	when it came to his, however, the top 'snap' of his case was slightly tight and when he snapped the kindle in place in the case, it caused a very small 'bow' in his kindle at the place of the top snap.	1
	he cannot safely remove his kindle from the case (in order to read the serial # on the back of the device, for instance).	1
	yesterday morning i examined his reader closely and saw a very small hairline crack at the place the kindle is bowed.	1
	i called the kindle customer support line yesterday to get what i thought would be support from amazon for my husband's twelve-day-old kindle.	1
	i described the problem to the rep. the person on the other end of the phone barely listened; he was very eager to get to the part of the discussion where he would be telling me it would cost $350 to get the case repaired.	1
	i responded that this was absolutely unacceptable.	1
	i said the problem was with amazon's defective case and i expected a new case and a new kindle.	1
	he noticed i had bought two extended warranties and said that under the terms of the warranty we could take advantage of a one-time replacement of the kindle.	1
	i responded that this was unacceptable as well.	1
	after all, i told him, if i did not have the extended warranty, would i be willing to pay $350 for a repair on the kindle?	1
	no.	1
	absolutely not.	1
	i reminded him that the problem lies with a faulty case that damaged the kindle out of the box.	1
	i asked to appeal to his superior.	1
	he said that when he had me on hold he already had spoken with that person.	1
	he then reiterated that they were willing to offer either a $350 repair or the one-time replacement under the extended warranty.	1
	i told him neither was acceptable and that i'd appeal to the kindle community for ideas on how to deal with this.	1
	my husband's kindle's functionality is not yet impaired, but it likely will be at some point, when the bow in the kindle causes the reader's casing to pry open.	1
	while we are delighted by our kindles in all other ways, i'm disappointed with our experience with amazon's support of the device and not sure where to go from here with the case-and-kindle issue.	1
	update july 14, 2009: i wrote amazon yesterday saying how disappointed i was with their not standing behind their errant case and subsequently damaged kindle.	1
	this morning was an e-mail waiting that said, 'we misunderstood you' blah blah.	1
	whatever they call it - misunderstanding or anything they want - they were ultra-responsive this time around.	1
	they gave me a # to call.	1
	the rep refunded the cost of the case on the spot.	1
	she sent me a prepaid label to ship the cracked kindle back to them.	1
	she promised a new kindle would arrive by july 21st - with the content of the old kindle loaded onto it.	1
	now i'm happy.	1
	using the kindle to travel with, store, and read books/magazines/newspapers/blogs is like a car is to walking: so.	1
	much.	1
	easier.	1
	i just love it.	1
	i'd go to five stars if this editing function on the reviews would allow it.      	1
	q & a on kindle dx.	1
	big problems with pdf compatibility.	1
	extremely fragile.while i agree with most that this is a wonderful addition to the kindle line, i'll share with you a nightmare story.	1
	one month into dx ownership, i was at a gathering of journalists over the 4th who were admiring my kindle dx.	1
	one of the children said, 'could i hold it.'	1
	sure, and within a flash the kindle dx fell face down to the floor from about 1.5 feet onto a small toy.	1
	hardly a tough drop or distance.	1
	well, the screen froze on a weird maze of lines and was rendered useless.	1
	in a flash $500 out the window.	1
	oh, i thought, let's call amazon and get this replaced.	1
	certainly they have anticipated freak and unfortunate accidents and would like to keep a longtime consumer vs. a short-term tech sale gouging on a repair.	1
	i wasn't looking for a a freebie, but a repaired replacement.	1
	so i was shocked after calling customer relations and said they could replace it for $350 dollars.	1
	now i have to ask all of you and myself.	1
	do i (we) really want to have $850 into a basic reader, albeit a nice one?	1
	i know it was my fault handing it to a curious child, but i must sadly retreat from this high tech adventure.	1
	especially when this large screen is so fragile that if one sits on it on a couch, drops it in the bathroom on a tile floor or whatever, and trust me, you will drop it at some point.	1
	if you have a child, when will they poke their finger into it or use a hard object?	1
	amazon needs a better swap and replacement policy for a product that i doubt can withstand the usage it will inevitably get.	1
	fyi.	1
	i have worked over 35 years in photography and journalism and worked with probably $100,000 + worth of delicate camera gear without an accident.	1
	this was my time i guess.	1
	so the kindle is a great idea that needs to be beefed up before it's ready for real-life use.	1
	and,  amazon needs a better swap policy for all of us soon-to-be 'i dropped it' people.      	1
	a full featured device for the avid reader.there have been many reviews on the dx here and elsewhere, and many of you reading this may be trying to decide if this is the ebook reader for you.	1
	i hope my comments might be helpful to those on the fence.	1
	as in any user review, the pros and cons listed here are specific to my own preferences and usage.	1
	what may seem a minor feature to me might be of much more significance to someone else, so i will try to explain why i like or dislike a particular feature so that the context of my critique might be better understood.	1
	as a preface, i will mention that i am a former kindle 2 owner.	1
	the kindle 2 will definitely be the answer for some, but the small screen and the lower contrast were enough for me to send the kindle 2 back to amazon and spend the extra money for the dx.	1
	i'll touch more on this a bit later in the review.	1
	i've organized the review into things i don't like about the dx followed by the critical points brought up by others that do not bother me much, and i end with an overview of the kindle's strengths.	1
	let's start with the faults: 1.)	1
	keyboard: yes, as mentioned by others, the keyboard design leaves much to be desired.	1
	the keys are widely spaced and small, and the feedback when pressing a key is variable.	1
	there are times when i thought i'd depressed the key fully only to see no letter on the screen.	1
	the keys are elevated nicely, however, which allows for some degree of touch typing, but i liked the keyboard on the kindle 2 better (despite the small, almost flush buttons).	1
	i do not take many notes when i read and i'm not using the kindle as a web browser often, so the keyboard shortcomings aren't a deal-breaker for me.	1
	given that the kindle is marketed towards students and other groups likely to annotate their content, the strange keyboard design is somewhat puzzling.	1
	2.)	1
	slow refresh: i almost hesitate to consider the somewhat sedate screen refresh a fault as it is present in every e-ink display, but it is indeed noticeable, and many people are quite bothered by it.	1
	i believe there are two components to the screen refresh: the first is the processing time required to render the page, and the second is the actual refresh of the screen.	1
	according to information on e-ink's product pages, the refresh time of the dx's screen is 740ms in 4-bit mode (16 shades of gray) and 260ms when it is in 1-bit mode (black and white).	1
	i don't think the dx is ever in 1-bit mode; on text-only pages, the lighter shades appear to be used for the status bar, the progress bar, and to provide antialiasing for the fonts.	1
	on the other hand, the processing time seems to vary and is pretty quick for text or simple graphics.	1
	more involved graphics in pdf files can take a few seconds to load.	1
	3.)	1
	content organization: this is one area where the kindle feels unfinished.	1
	with the breadth of content that can be stored on the kindle, the lack of the ability to create folders makes the content seem haphazard and disorganized.	1
	i'm hoping this fault will be remedied with a firmware update.	1
	4.)	1
	it is not a physical book: this may seem a laughable and somewhat obvious statement, but it holds merit.	1
	there are things you can do with a book that you can't do with the kindle.	1
	one of the major issues i've encountered is the lack of an ability to flip quickly through the book to find a specific part that you may want to reference or reread.	1
	yes, you can use the search function to find something if you know the exact word or phrase, or you can jump to a 'location' within the text, but if you just have a vague idea of something you want to locate, it is sometimes difficult to find on the kindle.	1
	also, with a physical book, you can loan or sell your copy when you are done if you so choose.	1
	kindle books are non-transferable (to other people, at least).	1
	critiques by others that don't bother me that much: 1.)	1
	amazon as big brother: yes, the orwell debacle was a huge misstep for amazon, but i give them kudos for admitting they were wrong and promising not to do it again.	1
	with such public assurance that this behavior will not be repeated, you can bet amazon will not be deleting content from kindle owners without their knowledge or consent.	1
	to do otherwise after their public statement would open them up to a huge amount of civil liability.	1
	2.)	1
	no color:  i understand the frustration at the lack of color, but color electrophoretic displays aren't available yet.	1
	it is a technology still in development, so i don't understand why people give the dx one star ratings for this reason.	1
	yes lcd displays are in color, but they require a power-hungry backlight and have annoying issues with eyestrain, poor outdoor readability, and limited off-axis viewing.	1
	one of the kindle's greatest strengths is its e-ink display.	1
	3.)	1
	expensive: yes, the dx is quite expensive, and i wish it was a bit cheaper.	1
	my guess is that it is a supply issue (note the recent 4 week stint where amazon had no stock).	1
	with inexpensive sony readers on the horizon and the upcoming touch-screen plastic logic device, prices are certain to come down.	1
	4.)	1
	no touch screen: i think this feature was not omitted without reason by amazon.	1
	while a touch screen would theoretically allow for a superior user interface, a reduced footprint (by eliminating the physical keyboard), and better/easier annotation ability, it also has the potential to reduce contrast, increase glare, and raise the price of the device.	1
	also, given the slow refresh of e-ink displays, a touch screen might feel somewhat awkward.	1
	that being said, i do hope the technology improves to the point where this feature might become a viable addition to the next generation of kindle...	1
	5.)	1
	weight/top heavy:  the dx is a bit over a pound in weight.	1
	some reviews have criticized the dx for its weight and for feeling top heavy.	1
	the kindle is almost the exact same weight as the hardcover version of the book freakonomics (a moderate sized hardback book of 320 pages).	1
	it is slightly more with the amazon-designed leather case, but it is definitely lighter than larger hardcover books.	1
	it is also slightly bottom heavy, not top heavy.	1
	you can confirm this fact by making a small tripod out of your thumb, index, and middle fingers - balance the dx on this 'tripod' and you will get a rough estimate of its center of gravity.	1
	on my dx, the balance point is slightly toward the keyboard side of center, meaning more of the weight of the device is concentrated in the bottom portion.	1
	the feeling of heaviness comes from the fact that the kindle is much denser than your average book.	1
	it therefore feels heavier when you hold it, but it is easy to transport and feels light when traveling.	1
	one-handed reading is possible, but it definitely feels more comfortable to hold in both hands.	1
	if you are a one-handed reader, the kindle 2 may be better for you (it feels great as a one handed reading device).	1
	one other suggestion - i find my tendency is to hold the dx so that my thumb is over the next page button.	1
	this button is towards the bottom of the device, so when holding the kindle upright, it feels 'heavy.'	1
	if you turn the dx upside down, and hold it with your left hand, the next page button will be further towards the top and your natural hand position will shift upwards, better balancing the weight of the device.	1
	i've found this position much more comfortable for one-handed reading.	1
	strengths: 1.)	1
	the screen:  i liked the kindle 2 as it is incredibly light and portable, but it was hard for me to get used to reading on the small screen.	1
	you don't realize how small a six inch screen is until you use one.	1
	i just measured one of my smaller paperback books, and the diagonal page size is a bit over 7.5 inches.	1
	the dx screen area is more akin to the page-area of a larger hardcover book.	1
	for some reason, the kindle 2 also seems to have lower contrast; the text was more of a dark gray instead of the crisp black of the dx.	1
	i read this critique before i bought the kindle 2, and based on videos and pictures i saw online, i didn't think it would be a big deal, but in the brief time when i had both devices, the difference was not subtle.	1
	the difference is more pronounced with smaller font sizes (which i preferred on the kindle 2 in order to maximize the amount of content per page).	1
	although the dx has a higher resolution screen when compared to the kindle 2,  the kindle 2 has a higher pixel density (166 ppi versus the dx's 150).	1
	i figured the added ppi would make text and graphics sharper, but in fact, the dx looks to have crisper text with higher contrast.	1
	i have no explanation for this difference.	1
	2.)	1
	thin/light:  the dx, despite its larger size when compared to the kindle 2, is still extremely portable.	1
	it makes traveling and doctor's office waiting enjoyable as you can have an entire library of content available to you in a reasonable form factor.	1
	it fits in a briefcase or laptop bag with ease and is not cumbersome to carry around.	1
	3.)	1
	whispernet/web access: the free, lifetime whispernet service is wonderful.	1
	being able to access online news, weather, wikipedia, and the like in any location with sprint service is very welcome, as is the ability to purchase or sample content at a whim.	1
	the web browser on the dx is significantly faster than the kindle 2 and the larger screen feels more natural for web content.	1
	one important caveat: the kindle's web browser is basic.	1
	it will not display complex content or video.	1
	while javascript is supported, flash is not.	1
	no hulu or youtube on the kindle (yet...)!	1
	4.)	1
	the kindle store:  the breadth of content available for the kindle is wonderful.	1
	i have found some books that i theoretically want that are not in the kindle store, but almost everything i've searched for has been available.	1
	i hope the library continues to improve.	1
	5.)	1
	dictionary: if you do not own a kindle, you may not realize how useful this feature is.	1
	i cannot count the number of times i have used this feature, and it is one of my favorite attributes of this device.	1
	by displaying definitions in the bottom margin, the feature is useful while remaining unobtrusive.	1
	6.)	1
	battery life: not much to say here - the battery life is amazing.	1
	unless you leave wireless on all the time, you can easily get several days of heavy reading on a full charge.	1
	7.)	1
	you forget you are using a digital device:  so many people have made this comment, it almost seems trite, but it is a genuine selling point.	1
	once you get over the giddiness at having the kindle and stop playing with it as a fancy gadget, it really becomes all about the content.	1
	reading is fun, and the dictionary and search functionality enhance the experience even further.	1
	this is a device for people who love to read, and it makes reading easy.	1
	my long-winded review is nearing its end.	1
	needless to say, i love the kindle dx, and for me it is a 4.5-star device.	1
	i'm not sure my rating would be so high if i was a college student or had hundreds upon hundreds of digital books, as the keyboard design and lack of organizational capacity do hinder the design somewhat.	1
	others will also like the portability of the kindle 2 better and won't care as much about the smaller screen size and lighter text.	1
	to each his/her own.	1
	as much as i enjoy my dx, i do hope amazon is hard at work for generation 2 of this device.	1
	the upcoming plastic logic device looks to have a promising ui and touch-screen capabilities, although the demo video i saw online made it seem like it was going to be very slow (it made the kindle look like a speed demon).	1
	the demo unit was an early prototype, however, and the final product will likely be much faster.	1
	similarly, the pixel qi screen seems a thing of sheer beauty, although i'm not sure what battery life would be like in a kindle-sized device.	1
	if apple were to incorporate this screen in their upcoming tablet, they would have a thin, potentially dx-sized device with a screen that has a refresh rate 1-2 orders of magnitudes faster than the dx with color, a touch-screen, excellent indoor/outdoor/darkened-room ability and apple's excellent user interface and application/content store.	1
	even at its rumored $700-900 price range, it would be a force to be reckoned with due to its vastly superior web and multimedia abilities.	1
	that's the future, though.	1
	i will argue that for right now, the kindle dx is as full-featured a device as current technology allows, with a beautiful screen, lifetime wireless service via whispernet, and a unrivaled content store.	1
	while a bit much for the casual reader, it is a godsend for the reading enthusiast, and for me, it was well worth the money.  	1
	it does everything i hoped for and more.i could write about the feel of the keyboard, or the weight, the size, and the speed of the screen refresh, but others have done this.	1
	these are very subjective and generally a matter of taste.	1
	thanks to all of those who pushed and prodded, lifted, and cuddled (their words not mine) these devices.	1
	for the most part you've done a great job with the periphery.	1
	i read these while waiting for my dx to arrive.	1
	thanks for giving me the tactile experience.	1
	i, however, take a slightly different view:  does the kindle dx meet the design aesthetic of the creator?	1
	i am an electrical/software engineer, an avid reader, and write as a hobby.	1
	i have an interest in all aspects of the kindle.	1
	i purchased the original kindle about a year ago and still today consider it one of the best purchases i've made.	1
	the primary reason i purchased the original kindle was for an improved experience when reading.	1
	i wasn't sure that was possible.	1
	most people who love to read do so because of the nearly magical feature of the brain to take dead lifeless symbols printed on paper and reconstitute the original intent and image of the writer's story; taking the reader into places never seen and even to the point of feeling things never felt.	1
	people who love to read will often 'see' the story and no longer 'see' the book.	1
	this is the pinnacle of the reading experience and paper books truly become the transport they are intended to be.	1
	so the question is... does the kindle dx meet and/or exceed the ability of a paper book to transport the reader to the place the writer wished to go to a point where it 'disappears' or 'fades away' when used?	1
	from my own experience i can say, yes it does.	1
	both my original kindle (coined kindle 1 by many people) and my kindle dx have proven this.	1
	does my kindle dx do this as well as my kindle 1?	1
	yes.	1
	does the kindle dx improve the reading experience over the kindle 1?	1
	yes, i dare say it does.	1
	how could the kindle dx improve on the reading experience of the kindle 1?	1
	while i love the kindle 1 and have tried over the last year to wear the buttons out on it, i was impressed by one of the features of the huge dx.	1
	the pan and scan of the eyes is greatly increased.	1
	in fact i sat my kindle 1 on the kindle dx and the screen of the kindle dx is larger than the entire kindle 1.  the size of the screen allows my eyes to have a more natural pan of the text that allows more information to be processed before jumping to the next line.	1
	therefore there are fewer 'breaks' in the reading allowing for more immersion into the story.	1
	the larger pages allow more time and information to be read before the even larger page turn breaks.	1
	therefore the i have noticed the kindle dx fades away even quicker than the kindle 1.  another unexpected advantage i noticed has to do with the physical dimensions and monotonic concepts.	1
	the kindle dx is quite large and when place in the reader's line of sight cuts-off much more field of view which really limits distractions.	1
	the white chassis does not pull the readers eye and nearly creates a movie screen for the 'movie' to play on.	1
	the conscious choices made to limit other perceived needs i think are very good choices.	1
	it's very rare anymore for a product developer to stay true to the intent and purpose of a device.	1
	they want to add gimmicky and slick additions that may not benefit and even detract from the pure purpose of the device just to add marketing value.	1
	i like the design of the kindle.	1
	it has a number of things that more conventional devices have (like laptops), but each item the kindle sports is not intended to do anything more than improve the reading experience.	1
	so what about the extras you get with the kindle?	1
	the blogs, magazines, news papers, personal documents etc.	1
	these are value added components.	1
	the primary focus of the kindle is to read books and make the experience equal to that of a paper book.	1
	these other items appear to confuse people as to the real purpose of the kindles.	1
	these are great features and i like them a lot.	1
	but when i read these, my purpose is different.	1
	i have shifted my focus from entertainment and experience, to information.	1
	i read a completely different way and i do not expect to be 'transported' as i am with a book.	1
	but these are valuable additions to the many features of the kindle and i believe improve the overall product.	1
	i also understand that some magazines are literary magazines and have the same intent as a book.	1
	the kindles do a great job with these also due to its design.	1
	for, in this respect, the magazine has the same intent as the book.	1
	now that i've stated my case for the kindle dx i would like to make a point about the price.	1
	a number of people seem concerned with the price.	1
	is this device worth $489?	1
	my answer is a strong yes, although i would not go any higher.	1
	here is my reasoning.	1
	first, the enjoyment i get from the kindle is greater than the price i paid.	1
	but on the economy of the thing:  many if not all people have hobbies or interests.	1
	consider the costs of your hobby or interest.	1
	some of these are incredibly expensive.	1
	let's consider a few (there are millions but this is for demonstration).	1
	gardening:  how much does it cost to garden?	1
	how much does it cost plants, fertilizers, landscaping materials, equipment, etc.	1
	per year?	1
	motorcycle:  how much does it cost to purchase a motorcycle, insurance, fuel, and maintenance?	1
	boat:  how much does a motor boat, sail boat, personal water craft, etc.	1
	cost?	1
	cable:  how much do you spend a year on cable?	1
	hunting:  how much does it cost to hunt?	1
	i know people who have purchased property just to have a place to hunt.	1
	piloting:  how much is the airplane, fuel, license, insurance, etc.?	1
	movies:  how much do tickets and a snack cost for 1 1/2 hours?	1
	take the amount spent on the hobby and then divide that price by the hours of use.	1
	then take the kindle and the price of the books and do the same thing.	1
	i think you'll find the kindle is one of the cheapest if not the cheapest.	1
	one thing to consider is the cover for the device.	1
	i chose the keep the original cover with my kindle 1.  the kindle 1 in its cover is about the size of a paperback book.	1
	but with the kindle dx, i chose the m-edge platform cover that allows it to stand up like an easel.	1
	it has proven itself to me to be a good choice due to the kindle dx's larger width.	1
	i will be writing a review for that cover also.	1
	i gave the kindle dx 5 stars because it does exactly what they said it will do and then some more and it met all my expectations.	1
	i review on the 'what is' and not the 'what if'.	1
	in my opinion there is no other digital reader that comes close to the kindle when you look at the whole package including the amazon service.      	1
	very poor pdf support.i purchased the kindle dx for the larger screen, and for the pdf support.	1
	but i wish i had waited for other offerings.	1
	the screen is larger, almost the size of a hard-cover book's page, and reading text on it is pleasant.	1
	but amazon's pdf support is very, very poor.	1
	it's nothing more than an image viewer.	1
	there is virtually nothing you can do when reading pdfs, other than flip pages.	1
	1. no hyperlinks support, so:-- no table of contents support-- no index support-- no footnote links support2.	1
	no dictionary support3.	1
	no annotation capabilities4.	1
	no zoom capabilities (so if you have very wide margins, but small text, you can't zoom in to make it readable.)	1
	the above are such basic requirements for anyone using pdfs, that i can't believe amazon let the kindle dx out of the door without implementing them.	1
	i am hoping these are fixed soon by a firmware update.	1
	but until better pdf functionality is implemented, i would advise staying away from the kindle dx, if pdf support is important to you.	1
	a more minor (for me) problem is the lack of dedicated numbers buttons.	1
	the kindle dx is too large to allow easy balancing, while simultaneously pressing the alt key, and pecking on the numbers keys to select a page.	1
	perhaps amazon can give us an alt key lock (press and hold for 2 seconds,) to make number punching easier.      	1
	overall, a solid e-book reader.	1
	deal-breaker: cannot anotate pdf's!.i have a kindle 2 and like it, but am mainly using it to read converted pdf's, so i was really excited about the kindle dx's touted ability to read pdf's natively.	1
	well i just received my dx yesterday and after playing around with it a bit, here are my impressions regarding its pdf abilities (the only reason i purchased it): on one hand it's pretty awesome to be able to read pdfs on the thing without the convoluted conversion and transfer process.	1
	pdfs are generally properly formatted, albeit on a smaller scale in portrait mode.	1
	also now you can read pdfs that cannot be converted at all (hard to email a 45mb pdf file to amazon for conversion, but just drop it into the dx and it's ready to go).	1
	grayscale images look great.	1
	however there are several major problems with the pdf viewer - 1) text can be myopia-inducingly small in portait view, and there's no way to zoom.	1
	2) on landscape view, text is crisp and very readable ... but you only get to see, say, 1/3 to 1/2 of a page, and to get to the other parts of the page you press 'next page' (instead of arrow down).	1
	in fact the pdf is in pseudo-continuous mode, meaning that every other screen is the bottom of one page and the top of another page.	1
	i say 'pseudo' because you can't scroll up or down line by line, only by sections of the page ... which means that many images are broken in half and the only way to see them in full is to go back to portrait view.	1
	3) as a corollary to #2, if there are columns of text, you have to hit 'next page' and 'previous page' several times to read all the text on one page in landscape mode.	1
	this is pretty annoying actually.	1
	5) but the deal-breaker for me is probably going to be: can't highlight (underline) text or make annotations!	1
	now, i do understand why this might be - many pdf's aren't formatted properly to say exactly where one line ends and the next one begins.	1
	but the best thing about the kindle 2 for me was the fact that i could select/mark text, and have it ready to be reviewed, or cut/pasted into other files.	1
	when i read i *have* to be able to make annotations, whether with a pencil or otherwise.	1
	the best you can do on the dx (with pdf's) is bookmark the page.	1
	not good enough : ( so unfortunately while i'd love to keep the dx and see all the diagrams and formatting in pdf's that don't convert or can't be converted to kindle format, it's probably not worth [...]      	1
	absence of folders and pdf notation.this kindle dx is my first kindle, and i was very excited to see this technology in action.	1
	it seems like a fantastic tool for reading kindle format books, and the fact that the whispernet access can be used to browse the web is really quite generous and more than i expected.	1
	however, my main reason for buying this device was the .pdf support, so that i could take large numbers of my own files in .pdf format and organize them on the device.	1
	being able to read these articles without having to print out thousands of pages, but on a screen that is easy on the eyes, and highly portable, seemed well worth the price.	1
	however, for this purpose, the kindle dx is woefully inadequate, which is all the more frustrating because its defects are due to a few relatively minor software issues.	1
	the way the files are accessed on the kindle, for instance, does not allow a folder system to categorize files beyond 'personal docs, subscriptions or books.'	1
	thus, if you have 100 .pdf documents about 10 different subjects, there is no way to create a folders for each of the 10 subjects - you are going to have to search through all 100 to find the document that you are looking for.	1
	this is obviously a massive pain, especially as with 3.4 gigs of memory, one could store thousand and thousands of such documents on the device.	1
	further, there is no way to add a note or annotations to the .pdf documents.	1
	apparently, the way that some users have been working around the lack of a folder system in previous models has been to add a note with some unique identifier, so that they could then search for that unique identifier and only those items would come up.	1
	thus, the fact that no notes, whatsoever, can be added to the .pdfs (even those that are not images, so they can even be searched), eliminates that workaround.	1
	further, it would generally be useful to be able to write some notes about the document, but there is no such ability at this time.	1
	these are two minor adjustments - adding a folder system and the ability to make notations in a .pdf.	1
	i don't even need the ability to highlight in .pdf - you could just drop a note in the body.	1
	until those changes are made, however, this will essentially ruin the device for my intended use.	1
	if amazon is not willing to make these minor changes or provide some plausible explanation for why the changes are not being made, it shows a high disregard for their customers' expectations and bodes poorly for the future potentials of this device.  	1
	first time e-book reader owner's observations.i didn't buy the first kindle.	1
	when the second came around, i actually placed a pre-order then changed my mind.	1
	i'm not a huge book reader other than the technical texts i need for my job and the academic ones i need for my degree.	1
	when the dx was announced, though, i knew i had to have one, primarily for the pdf support.	1
	i do read a lot of pdf files and not having to print them out is a big boon (not to mention makes me feel good in a tree hugging way).	1
	so, this is my first foray into ebook readers and i have been the proud owner of a kindle for one whole day.	1
	i have to admit the automated delivery of the financial times and newsweek are very compelling.	1
	the price, however of magazines and newspapers do not seem to be in line with the cost savings afforded by the electronic medium.	1
	in the case of the wall street journal and the financial times, it is actually cheaper to subscribe to the print edition than to get it via the kindle.	1
	granted, the kindle does not have the advertising that the print edition does, but given the price of newsprint, ink, and delivery, i would expect a discount for the electronic format over the physical one.	1
	pricing on the books by contrast, is generally pretty good, although some of the computer security texts i have looked at are cheaper in print than in the kindle format, so it makes sense to check before purchasing.	1
	one of the most striking negatives for me has been the weight of the dx.	1
	it is not comfortable to hold with one hand for a long period of time (which would be the way i would read a paperback book).	1
	at 18.9 oz., it is almost twice the weight of the kindle 2, making the 2 probably a better option for someone who is just interested in books.	1
	the larger screen however is a better choice for people like me who read pdf files on it or technical documents, so you kind of have to make a choice.	1
	as for the price, which has been criticized in the recent past, i read an article recently on the kindle 2 where a company ripped a kindle 2 open and priced out the components.	1
	the price of the kindle 2 was roughly twice the cost of components.	1
	given that fact, the price seems reasonable to me when you consider that you need to recoup your r&d; costs as well as pay licensing fees to the folks who own the e-ink patents, etc.	1
	at $350 - $500 these are still luxury items for the early adopters.	1
	don't even try to build a cost justification over purchasing regular books.	1
	you buy a kindle because 1. it is cool  2. it lets you carry an entire library with you in a small and light form factor, and 3. because it is far less wasteful in terms of natural resources.	1
	all things considered, i'm reasonably pleased, but the price on the periodicals needs to come down to entice me to subscribe.      	1
	upsized!	1
	(worth every penny).	1
	it's not that heavy, people!	1
	don't compare it to kindle 1 or 2.i wasn't going to write a review since i got this as a gift for my husband.	1
	after reading most of the reviews i noticed a chief complaint was how heavy it is.	1
	it arrived today and as i was picking it up, i thought it was going to weigh a ton.	1
	it's 18oz people!	1
	that's a little more than 1 lb.	1
	most books weigh more than that.	1
	the kdx is really lightweight.	1
	my husband has never owned a kindle1 or 2 and had more of an unbaised review.	1
	his only complaint so far is that reading with lamp light behind you, there's a glare on the screen if you tilt the kdx the wrong way.	1
	his other praises are what others have already written.         	1
	[edited] kindle dx review.it is easy to set up and start reading right away.	1
	there are a lot of free books available both through amazon and other channels.	1
	i enjoy reading older novels anyway.	1
	but it is nice being able to read a review in the economist or something, and download a free sample, and then purchase the entire book all in a couple minutes.	1
	also, i received a replacement kindle dx after cracking the top corner.	1
	i learned my lesson and purchased an overpriced protective cover that has held up well.	1
	some caveats:  1) no left-hand navigation.	1
	2) no folders to organize the books.	1
	everything is put into the same archive once you remove it from your device.3) don't rely on this device for any kind of internet capability.	1
	4) the navigation knob is clunky, and the most adept reader will mistakenly scroll too far, not far enough, or onto another page entirely.5) too much lagtime in opening a new book, turning on wireless, switching from home page to another page, etc.	1
	6) i was told by an amazon representative that this was a publisher's formatting decision: for some books, clicking the joystick does not bring me to the previous or next chapters.	1
	i can't skip from chapter to chapter.	1
	all books should be navigable by chapter.	1
	amazon needs to streamline all publisher formatting.	1
	if they refuse to do this, they must let the consumer know about this deficiency prior to purchasing the book.	1
	i do not want to purchase a book that would be more convenient in paper form.	1
	i probably would have gotten the ipad had i waited for its rollout.	1
	but i don't regret getting the dx, as the e-ink is a pleasure to read and i don't find myself trotting all over the internet instead of getting absorbed in a book.      	1
	kindle dx vs apple's new ipad.i've been in the market for an e-reader for the last 6 months, but hesitated because of the new crops of e-readers that would be coming out in 2010. i knew 2010 will be the year for e-readers and i probably would be debating which e-reader to get for months to come.	1
	in the end, i decided to go with the kindle dx (global) edition; just received it yesterday.	1
	my main reason for going with the kindle dx is because of its size, e-ink technology and the 3g wireless (no charge).	1
	i'm an it engineer who reads many, many certification books, pdf white papers and the kindle dx just fits the bill; perfect (pdf support could be a bit better, however).	1
	i look at lcd; led screens all day long a part of my job.	1
	when i'm in my studying mode, which is often, reading my certification books on e-ink technology (now) is pure pleasure; even on the hardcover books.	1
	i just can't see doing any e-reading on the ipad or any other device that have back-lighting.	1
	my take on apple's new ipad is...it is awesome and a nice piece of technology.	1
	the price is in-line and it is a tremendous value for what you're getting.	1
	i was a blackberry fan since they first came out and had every version (part of the perks of being in it) and often told myself... 'i would never buy an iphone'.	1
	in sept 08' i found myself ditching my new 8830 world edition bb for the 2 gen iphone...never looked back.	1
	it is probably my best piece technology and i have all the latest and greatest toys.	1
	(don't get me started) the point is this, some people, if not many, will pay for the ipad because of it functionality, value and probably to have the latest and greatest.	1
	for some people who are strictly looking for an e-reader (like me) and have done their research know the e-ink technology is the king technology for e-readers.	1
	it is much easier on the eyes, not to mention on the battery life.	1
	so in my opinion, to compare the ipad and kindle (dx) is unfair, but understandable.	1
	most people who are in the market for a netbook or an e-reader will most likely and should include the ipad.	1
	i think the ipad will be more of a threat to netbooks (and small inexpensive laptops), than to the kindle dx or the new sony daily edition e-reader.	1
	in short, huge fan of the new ipad, my iphone is my best friend (will be trading it in for the 3gs; upgrade offer is coming up), but i will not be trading my new kindle dx for the ipad; as much as the tech-side of me wants to.	1
	pleased with tradeoffs.i had the luck, good or bad, to buy the kindle 2 just days before amazon announced the dx.	1
	as a result, i used the k2 briefly, then returned it and bought the dx.	1
	my first reaction to the k2 (before the dx was announced) was that it would be a great product if the screen were bigger.	1
	for comfortable reading i had to go to a font one size bigger than standard, and the amount of text on the k2 screen at this size seemed to be about half a normal paperback page.	1
	when reading a book, you read two pages before turning a page, so i was turning pages on the kindle four times as often as i would when reading a book.	1
	i found that this interfered with the reading experience.	1
	the dx solves that problem with the larger screen.	1
	i increased the font size and also increased the margin to get a comfortable line length.	1
	i've read two books and part of another and now find the experience excellent.	1
	the added weight is a trade-off, but for me an acceptable one.	1
	the k2 weighs as much as a small paperback, while the dx weighs as much as a medium-sized paperback (say, 6 x 9, 350 pages).	1
	it's a bit less comfortable to hold than a paperback, though, because it feels top-heavy.	1
	yet i was able to read it without discomfort throughout a two-hour flight despite having mild arthritis in my wrists.	1
	(it attracted a fair amount of attention on the flight, and my wife kidded me about the dx being a chick magnet.)	1
	apart from the larger screen, the other big deal for me is the pdf reader.	1
	reading business documents on a plane has always been a problem -- laptops are awkward and uncomfortable for extended reading, and paper shuffling is a hassle.	1
	nowadays just about anyone can create a pdf from most types of documents.	1
	to get them on your dx, all you have to do is connect the included cable to your computer.	1
	the dx opens as if it were a flash drive, so you can drag and drop your pdf files and you're ready to go.	1
	this is a huge plus for business users, and many road warriors will find that this feature alone justifies the price of the dx.	1
	people with younger eyes will probably be comfortable with the smaller font and may prefer the k2 for its handier size and lighter weight.	1
	for me, the dx is well worth the added price.	1
	finally, here's a practical tip.	1
	i didn't want to buy a case until there were more choices, but i needed to protect the dx in my carry-on bag.	1
	it turns out that a #2 bubble mailer (8-1/2 x 12) fits like a glove.	1
	i can certainly afford a more elegant case but i may stick with this solution because it offers adequate protection and convenience, and adds nothing to the weight.      	1
	good start.to be honest, purchasing the kindle was more of a 'vote with my wallet' gesture than the purchase of a useful item.	1
	i am very happy that the industry is starting to think about how to print without using paper.	1
	i am satisfied with the dx in that it's a neat device that functions pretty well.	1
	however it doesn't hold up to my - admittedly high - standards.	1
	first, the problems: durability and quality of content.	1
	my mom (who loves the kindle by the way) said 'i can give a book to my children and they can give it to their children and so on for a hundred years.	1
	how long is this kindle going to last?'.	1
	in answering her i mentioned the books you buy are stored online and they would last as long as amazon is around.	1
	she was still skeptical: 'how long is amazon going to be around?'.	1
	and i have no answer for that - i think she brings up an interesting point.	1
	where is the certainty that you get with a well taken care of book?	1
	amazon should add some kind of long term guarantee on the purchases (and guard from a re-occurrence of the recent orwellian fiasco).	1
	furthermore, the device itself could and should be made to last a very long time.	1
	what difference are we really making if we exchange one disposable medium for another?	1
	i suggest waterproofing, tougher parts, glass screen, etc.	1
	as it is, the kindle (especially the screen) feels like a piece of paper in terms of sturdiness.	1
	let's not forget that a book can survive a toss across the room and a soaking in the river and still serve you faithfully.	1
	my second problem with the kindle isn't so much with the device, as with the books available for it.	1
	i spent over $30 on a great math book: proofs from the book.	1
	if you buy it in print, it costs about the same but gives life to beautiful proofs in mathematics.	1
	in kindle form it is unreadable.	1
	the proofs are smudged and washed out and you can't make out an 'm' from an 'n' or an 'r'.	1
	to date, my complaints about it have not been answered.	1
	browsing through other content i find similar problems.	1
	beautiful pictures stripped out, font ignored, etc.	1
	i don't believe this is a limitation of the device as it displays the screen saver pictures quite beautifully.	1
	i hope it's just growing pains and the books will be updated.	1
	on the positive, the kindle is easy and friendly to read.	1
	i do not annotate or mark books too much (i always have an inferiority complex to the great writers that i read) so the lack of a friendly keyboard does not bother me.	1
	i look up words and doing this on the kindle is a pleasure - i do it much more frequently than with real books.	1
	i take the kindle with me on trips and i've convinced airplane staff that it does not have an on/off switch so they let me keep reading it while the plane takes off (shhhh about holding down the slider button for five seconds :)).	1
	i'm glad i bought it.	1
	the $500+ i spent on it is well worth it and i hope to see the changes that would make this the perfect device coming in kindle 3 or kindle 4.      	1
	a k2 owner reviews the dx.i really love my kindle 2 but decided to order the dx because i was intrigued by the larger screen of the dx and wanted to see how the two kindles compare.	1
	hands down the dx is a better e-reader despite being bigger and heavier.	1
	the key advantage is the larger screen which can hold a lot more words and information on a page than the k2.	1
	even at very large font sizes the dx still looks like a page from a book.	1
	the contrast is also much sharper on the dx - something i noticed right way when i first turned it on.	1
	the words seem darker and crisper.	1
	the dx is faster than my k2 when i am opening books, turning pages or even accessing the web.	1
	with respect to the pdf feature i can't critique the dx because i don't read a lot of pdfs.	1
	for what i do read which are some pdfs and word documents it works well.	1
	although the dx is bigger and heavier than the k2 this in no way compromises the user-friendliness of the reader.	1
	there is only a marginal difference in how heavy the device feels as compared to the k2 and the increased dimensions are not so significant that it affects portability.	1
	this can easily fit into a large handbag (albeit not a small purse).	1
	as a normal sized woman with the typical upper body strength of a woman i am sensitive to carrying around heavy things and the dx does not feel that much different than my k2.	1
	in short, as much as i love my k2, i am really happy i bought the dx and will likely use this exclusively.	1
	i will use it primarily for pleasure reading and for reading pdfs and other work documents.	1
	i am not taking any classes so i won't be using it for textbook reading (and i have not tested textbooks on the dx).      	1
	more a miss than a hit..i have owned 5 kindles in every model.	1
	i love the kindle concept, and my kindle 2 is my constant companion.	1
	i wanted to like the kindle dx.	1
	my review might seem a bit negative, but i wanted to get all the issues i have with it out in the open so you can make a better choice between models.	1
	i have a friend who is now selling his kindle 2 he loves the kindle dx so much.	1
	he mostly reads subscriptions to newspapers and blogs, which i don't ( i currently read mostly fiction).	1
	he likes the superior formatting of this material.	1
	the positives: the screen is a bit better, the dark grey (the kindle does not have a true black) text is a shade darker than the 2, and is crisper.	1
	though the unit is bigger, i had no problem carrying it, or putting it in my small man bag.	1
	it renders pdfs quite nicely, it's great to see a full page on the screen.	1
	the screen rotation is nice.	1
	the fit and finish is every bit as good as the kindle 2.  blogs from kindlefeeder.com  are formatted better for the larger screen.	1
	the negatives:  the deal breaker for me was to find out that pdf reader does not support internal links, or a table of contents.	1
	i wanted the dx to carry and read large documents like technical manuals, dummies books and scripts.	1
	you can view a table of contents, but you cannot go to chapter 3!	1
	i don't understand how the dx could be used for text books without linking, it's pretty much a paperweight.	1
	you can  go to page numbers, but how are you going to know what page number to go to?	1
	you also cannot highlight or add notes to pdfs.	1
	no left buttons.	1
	i am left-handed, and am slightly offended by this.	1
	i also know two people who don't have right hands.	1
	you can flip it upside down and use the buttons on the left, but they arent' in the right place or order then.	1
	there are no separate numeric keys, they are alt keys that you have to press alt for every number you want to put in.	1
	the alt keys don't work well in any of the kindle models because you need to press the keys too hard, and pressing two keys takes some pressure and a bit of juggling.	1
	(i'd love to see them put a button that turns on the keyboard and have easier key presses on the keyboard).	1
	it's heavy for long-term reading (yes, i lift weights and have strong hands).	1
	it's not heavy for reading half an hour of the wall street journal, but it gets heavy after an hour of reading a novel.	1
	also, i found that i was moving the dx around and shifting my weight a lot more because of its weight (and glare and eye focus).	1
	i think the dx size could work better if it was balanced and molded differently.	1
	the screen is affected by glare more.	1
	it has the same non-glare surface, but since it's bigger there always seems to be a part of the screen that has a glare under strong reading lights.	1
	so i end up tilting the screen a bit as i go down every page, causing more hand movement that becomes a problem combined with the weight etc.	1
	the larger screen caused me more eye strain.	1
	my eyes had to move up and down the screen for every page.	1
	the kindle 2 (because it's smaller) your eye stays pretty much in one place.	1
	also because i needed to tilt the screen a bit with every page read to eliminate glare, my eyes needed to change focus more as well.	1
	i didn't care for reading pages with that much text on them.	1
	i would tend to get lost in a full page of text when it used medium default text size, so i ended up using quite large text on the dx, which defeats the purpose of all that real estate.	1
	i fully admit that this gripe is probably pretty oddball.	1
	the conclusion: overall i enjoy the experience of reading fiction better on the kindle 2 which is my primary use of the kindle now, so i will be returning the dx.	1
	pushing the next button more often on the kindle 2 is overall less annoying than what i began to call the dx dance of constantly adjusting the dxs position and my body position.	1
	you can't really use the kindle 2 to read formatted pdfs, so the dx is the only game in town for that.	1
	if the dx adds support for table of contents and internal linking, i would probably buy it again to use for pdfs, but i will keep reading fiction on the kindle 2.       	1
	kindle dx's ability to display complex structures and form function of a bigger unit..	1
	really bad screen - scratches really easy.just got off with amazon regarding a bad scratch on my dx.	1
	oh well they tell me they don't support that unless i got the added insurance.	1
	now, this is my 3rd kindle and i have not treated my other kindles as carefully as i have treated this one and i have never had a scratch on them.	1
	the dx is in a cover (m-edge) that has a strap to keep it closed.	1
	it never goes anywhere without the cover on it, never!	1
	so when i opened it up yesterday, it looked like it has some dirt on it and when i tried to wipe it off, i discovered it was a small series of scratches.	1
	they must be using the leftover screens from the original ipods (you remember, don't you?	1
	the ones that you have to get screen covers or you couldn't even read anything on that little mini screen because it was so scratched up).	1
	i wouldn't suggest getting this model because of this problem.	1
	they want over $300 to fix it.	1
	i don't very often write reviews but i am so upset about this, that i am going to shout it from roof tops just to alert everyone i know and everyone i don't know about this.	1
	maybe, just maybe, amazon will listen and fix this expensive problem.      	1
	as good as i had hoped.this is my first kindle--the dx and leather cover arrived today.	1
	i had pretty high expectations (hopes) for a good, easy to use product.	1
	the dx is pretty satisfactory--not perfect, but pretty darn good.	1
	perhaps the best single feature, surprisingly, is how easy it is on the eyes.	1
	i did a side-by-side comparison with the same book--kindle vs. book.	1
	i had never really thought much about eye stress while reading, and i read a lot.	1
	but the kindle was much easier on my eyes, even using a pretty small font, than a traditional book.	1
	this was very surprising, and is a great feature for people who read a great deal.      	1
	it's not a portable library, it's a portable bookstore..	1
	lack of transferability makes the dx not worth the price difference.i was extremely excited to be getting my kindle dx.	1
	i am a doctoral student, and therefore have to read a number of journal articles in pdf format on a regular basis, so i justified the dx.	1
	however, the dx just didn't live up to my expectations.	1
	as other reviewers have said, the dx reads the pdf file as is.	1
	you cannot adjust font, you can't access notes that may already be on the file, and you can't access links or pictures.	1
	but here's the real problem for me as a student...i can't take notes on the actual pdf file.	1
	so, i tried to go the way of sending it as a document to take my notes.	1
	and while i can take my notes, they are stored in the my clippings rather than on the document itself and there is no way to convert back from what is on the kindle to what can be read on your laptop.	1
	as a student, who supposedly this kindle is being marketed to, this is a huge downside.	1
	the lack of being able to take notes directly on something and being able to transfer that information back and forth is vital to a student who is trying not to have to print out every single thing she has to read.	1
	and while the screen was nice and the extra memory was tempting, i just couldn't justify the price difference between the kindle dx and the kindle 2. as some of said before, the larger size actually makes it somewhat uncomfortable to hold while reclining.	1
	so, i sent my dx back and ordered the kindle 2. i received the kindle 2 today and i can tell already it was the smarter choice for me because if i am going to have to go in circles to keep notes from documents, i'd much rather do it on a less expensive, more compact, and more comfortable to hold unit.	1
	if future dx generations allow you to alter the pdf file, or if you are just given the ability to reconvert a document, that will help my opinion on the kindle dx and honestly the kindle in general.       	1
	green tech: almost there.overall, i'm pretty happy with the kindle and the availability of books and publications from the kindle store (taking into consideration the slow pace with which ereaders are catching on).	1
	after a few days of using the device this is my take: cons:  pdfs - ability to comment and highlight are not available w/ regard to pdfs.	1
	disappointing considering this was one of my primary reasons for getting the device b/c i download, read and like to note professional journal articles.	1
	emailed amazon and they state that adding this function is not currently on their list (hopefully that changes).organization - i like to have documents and books organized into folders (and since you can store about 3500 books this is important in my opinion).	1
	when connected to a computer the kindle documents can be organized into folders but when viewing the home page there are no such organizational options.	1
	pros:100% mac/apple compatible: the kindle, when plugged in, comes up in finder as an external drive.	1
	just drag and drop documents as you wish...word docs, pdfs, etc.	1
	you're good to go mac users.easy on the eyes: the screen is great with regard to size and how relaxed my eyes feel reading on the device.	1
	i hate reading on a computer screen and this is awesome.	1
	in fact, i love reading on this device so much that i'm reading more than i ever have.easy to use: basic usage is intuitive and easy to use for the average person who is familiar with computers.	1
	simple and straight forward.	1
	also, the size of the device is great.reading material: given the slow pace of ereader popularity i would say that the availability of books/publications is pretty good.	1
	given the difficult pricing/profit structure of amazon i can see why mags, etc.	1
	are slow to convert.	1
	however, i would email your publications and encourage them to develop a kindle edition.	1
	if enough of us bug them i think they'll develop a version for kindle.	1
	especially since their costs are drastically reduced.	1
	regardless, the samples they give you before you buy a book is awesome, typically a full chapter.going green: i have been waiting for a device like this and the amount of paper that i'm saving by transferring documents from my computer to the kindle is amazing.	1
	in addition, buying books, newspapers and magazines is easy and super quick.portrait or landscape view: when reading pdfs, journal articles for me, the landscape view makes reading a lot easier by increasing the text size.battery: great battery and reading time.	1
	love that you can turn the wireless signal off to save your charge.custom amazon case: simple construction, hooks in securely to the kindle and has a magnetic closure so it doesn't fly open.	1
	good thickness and i feel like it's really protecting the device.	1
	suggestions to amazon:add comment/highlight function for pdfsadd document/folder organizing functionality on home screentouch screen - this would allow for easy highlighting, selecting, etcadjust pricing structure so publishers won't hesitate to create a kindle edition while the pdf commenting and highlighting is a huge disappointment for me i'm still keeping the device.	1
	i sure hope they upgrade the software to include this.	1
	regardless, the device is great and so easy to use.	1
	i'm going on a bit of faith that book and publication availability will continue to increase.	1
	and finally, i love the fact that i'm not wasting materials.	1
	my wife does a ton more reading than i do and we're already saving tons of paper and trees.	1
	love it.	1
	definitely worth the 500!	1
	enjoy!      	1
	pdf support and screen are nice, but otherwise clunky.	1
	fragile garbage.amazon has designed a horrible product.	1
	it's ridiculously fragile.	1
	mine slipped off my lap while i was readng and cracked.	1
	amazon refused to replace it.	1
	i've accidentally dropped my cell phone on hard floors many times with no ill-effects.	1
	yet, the kindle cracks in half just slipping off my lap onto a carpeted floor.	1
	amazon is selling a mobile product but they don't design it to accomodate the kind of wear and tear a mobile product is usually subjected to.	1
	bad industrial design and bad customer service.      	1
	my first kindle (dx model) and i'm pleased..	1
	kindle dx: bigger and better.i just finished my first session with the kindle dx, and i am absolutely delighted.	1
	i have subscribed to the customer service blogs for the kindle 2, and have watched 'nit pick' after 'nit pick' come cascading from people, who quite frankly, need to get a life.	1
	if you do not want a book for a penny more than $9.99, don't buy it!	1
	if you are in the remote hills of asia, and the product is wireless only in the usa, move home!	1
	and so on!when you turn on your dx, you are now holding a perfectly sized book, substantailly heavier, but, oh, those large fonts.	1
	they are glorious.	1
	i am 55 years old and have had lasik surgery on one eye only.	1
	my vision corrects to 20-20 without glasses, but neither close-up nor far away feel absolutely perfect.	1
	that is the price i pay for not having to wear glasses.with the kindle dx, the font is perfect, using one of the two larger sizes.	1
	compared to the kindle 2, there is more content per page turn for the same size font, due obviously to the increased real estate on the screen.next, when i am wanting to find something, like for example a bible verse, i go to a smaller font, and get way more content.	1
	once i am where i need to be, a quick pop to a larger font has me home free.of course, i want the backlight and the color, and would pay for them, but they will come in due course.	1
	do not subscribe to the usa today, unless you want a very watered down view of the paper.	1
	this device is not ready for a color newspaper.	1
	you would be much better served by subscribing on your pc, or reading the free usa today site on your iphone or pc.the iphone integration continues to be superb, and if you want a quick bedtime read, it is backlit!the downloading and upgrading remain remarkably easy.obviously, removing the left side buttons was a terrible mistake, and the cries of horrified anger will undoubtedly cause the problem to be solved on the next generation.will the next kindle be better?	1
	of course!	1
	will the next imac be better?	1
	of course!	1
	will the next generation windows computer be better?	1
	of course.	1
	ditto for flat screen tv's, cars, and telephones.if you are a technology freak who has to get the latest and greatest immediately, you already have your dx.	1
	if you are almost that far towards the 'bleeding edge' you should enthusiastically pony up for this baby, 'cause you are going to love it.	1
	you already know that you can sell your dx for about 70% of what you paid for it when the next one comes out.	1
	as a matter of fact, if the next one has color and/or backlighting, and you buy it the first day, you will get almost 90% if you sell quickly.so, if you are a first time kindl'r, it is time to get in the game.	1
	if you are an upgrade candidate, this is a clear buy if screen size and font size matter.	1
	when the backlit, color version hits, watch for my presale, i always keep my equipment in brand new condition!      	1
	folders folders folders folders.look, the kindle is great.	1
	but the lack of folders is one of those things so monumentally stupid that it's not just inconvenient, it actually makes you angry dealing with.	1
	like, you're all ready to have a nice time reading your book and then you encounter this list of 100's of books and you start scrolling through page after page looking for what you want and by the time you find it, you're pissed off.	1
	not because it was so hard, but because, as anyone who has even the most basic computer knows, it doesn't have to be that way.	1
	and so now you're angry, and it's infected your whole experience.	1
	i mean.	1
	why why why?	1
	and if you're like me, some of this is just basic organization.	1
	like i want my books one place and the documents i look at for business another place.	1
	again, this is so basic it becomes frustrating and frustrating is supposed to be the opposite of the experience.	1
	again when it comes to showing off with your nifty kindle.	1
	you're with a bunch of people, want to show off your cool kindle dx, so you boot it up to show them a book and well, hold on there.	1
	you can't find the damn book and in the meantime everyone's looking at all the strange other books you have plus your files from work and... you get it?	1
	it's the pleasure killer.	1
	it's technological death.	1
	again, not because it's a huge deal, but because it's a small nagging stupidity that just glares at you.	1
	this is a deal breaker for me.	1
	sent mine back.	1
	amazon, what are you thinking?	1
	we had folders on our pcs and macs back in the 80's, more than twenty years ago.        	1
	terrible pdf support for students.though the kindle dx is great for casual reading, it is obviously not designed for students in mind, rather, was designed for readers, and then had the student label slapped on it after the fact.	1
	the noting and annotation is rather cumbersome in the first place, requiring you to type on a crappy little keyboard that was designed for quick searching, not note writing.	1
	the other issue with annotation is the way it handles pdfs.	1
	it doesn't.	1
	yes, you can read pdfs, but you cannot highlight or take notes in any manner.	1
	i bought the kindle mainly to take notes on the 100s of pages of pdfs my college gives me a semester, and yet i can only read them.	1
	i am sadly and promptly returning the product.	1
	if it ever gets a software update to allow for this functionality, i will gladly buy it, but until then, stop labeling it for students, and please amazon, clarify the limitations of 'native pdf support'.      	1
	outstanding display.	1
	unparalleled, but pdf support is poor - not for prime time use for professionals.i waited 1 year+ for a kindle that had native pdf support - for reading text books, tech manuals, paper documents in pdf.	1
	i could have gotten the sony ereader pr505, but i needed highlighting and note-taking support - so i got the dx.	1
	while there is nothing else like it on the market, it still leaves so much to be desired.	1
	here's the fine print for the native pdf support (which really should be stated in the product specifications) 1. you cannot change font size while reading pdf.	1
	2. you cannot highlight, or take notes, while reading a pdf.	1
	there is no work around for this.	1
	you can't go into 'my clippings' and try to add a note, or highlight.	1
	3. you cannot look-up word definitions from a pdf in the usual way.	1
	a text-based pdf can be searched, but one cannot select and look-up any word.	1
	no matter what you do the cursor doesn't show up when you move the 5-way button.	1
	only work around for dictionary look-up is to conduct a search, type word in and select 'dictionary' in the search tool bar.	1
	4. of course, no text to speech either for the pdf file.	1
	basically, expect the pdf view in kindle dx as read-only.	1
	you want to take notes?	1
	best to have the pdf converted, and get charged for conversion/delivery fee.	1
	i honestly don't know why amazon feel entitled to charge us for the fee given that the conversion is the only true work-around to dx's poor pdf support.	1
	i felt like i was swindled - this was not what i was led to believe by amazon regarding dx's native pdf support.	1
	i can't believe i spent $100+ more over the kindle 2 only to find out that i would still need to convert my pdf to .mobi for any worth while reading experience.	1
	everything else on the dx is the same as kindle 2, only the dx is much more awkward to use.	1
	dx is heavy, so you really need to have both hands holding it while you read.	1
	since the left hand side 'next page' and 'prev page' buttons are removed, good luck trying to reach for that cup of joe with your right hand while turning the page with your left hand.	1
	yes, you can change orientation to have the buttons be on your left hand side...but what if you need to take notes, or jump to a section?	1
	you have to re-flip it around to get the abcs oriented unless typing upside down is your forte.	1
	and what is the deal with removing that one row of numeric buttons on the dx?	1
	if you want to jump to page 45 or section 45, you have somehow balance your dx while you hold down the alt-button and hit the 'r' and 't' buttons.	1
	this is near impossible to do if you are trying to read on a crowded commuter train while balancing your backpack on your lap.	1
	this design omission is incomprehensible since there are plenty of space for that one row of numeric buttons.	1
	i'm sorely disappointed in kindle dx.	1
	i hope amazon will release firmware upgrade soon to improve dx's substandard pdf support.	1
	at the very least please give us a work-around to allow us to take notes in pdf, or offer pdf conversion over-the-air for free.	1
	as it is right now, it is not useful for the dx's intended audience.        	1
	kindle is a bad idea.i have had a kindle dx for about a week and now the screen died.	1
	tech support insists that i dropped it which i didn't or leaned on it which i didn't.	1
	it has been loved and babied like an infant since i've had it.	1
	who knows, perhaps inadvertently it did get damaged.	1
	should something that costs so much be so fragile that you can't even remember injuring it?	1
	tech support now expects me to give them $350 to fix it since 'damage' is not covered in their replacement policy.	1
	so instead i threw it up against the wall and then dropped it in the trash can.	1
	now, at least, i can state that yes, it was damaged.	1
	i will never buy another item from amazon. 	1
	pdf viewing disappointment.there is another detailed review of pdf viewing by las cosas that is also worth reading.	1
	receiving my kindle dx, i have to say my i have mixed feelings.	1
	owning both the sony prs-505 and now the kindle dx, i was hoping the larger screen would make 8' x 11.5' formatted pdfs legible.	1
	the short answer is yes, but the contrast is poorer (than a kindle document) and the margins sometime remain (read las cosas's review for more detail), taking away valuable real estate that could have been used to increase the pdf's size.	1
	i also noticed that you have none of the font resizing, word clipping, direct chapter links or other kindle centric features in viewing a pdf.	1
	essentially the only pdf features are search, specific page entry and rotating the document.	1
	rotating the document does increase the size, and in some pdfs they actually display better in ledger mode.	1
	however, the pdf engine does not seem to render the page correctly for each page turn -- slowly displacing the pages so it looks like a slow vertical crawl that you would see on a tv with vertical alignment problems.	1
	to those of who think the larger size is unwieldy.	1
	i find it handles like a stiff covered magazine and easily read in bed with standard night table lamp.	1
	being right handed, i find the controls comfortable.	1
	i have found that the accelerometer is sensitive and when activated, the pause to get back to your original orientation is too long.	1
	luckily you can override the auto mode to prevent it from changing positions unintentionally.	1
	overall, i will have to say the pdfs are rendered well and reasonably fast compared to the sony prs-505.	1
	i just hope that the limited pdf navigation is not some way to appease the market for pdf viewing, yet keep the kindle format in forefront with a richer set of navigation and annotation tools.	1
	i hope to see better pdf tools in the kindle dx's next firmware upgrade.	1
	first review.	1
	beautiful device, needs some improvements.	1
	just plain bad.	1
	not recommended the kindle was used approximately 4 times and kept in a computer case.	1
	the screen broke inside the unit the kindle disservice department tells me and it is my fault, they say!	1
	amazon will replace it for $350.00 after i had it less than 45 days..not recommended      	1
	kindle dx as business document reader.i purchased the kindle dx to test it as a possible technical document reader for construction foremen in the field.	1
	i initially had difficulty getting the unit to be recognized by my laptop and the kindle support team were tremendous in helping me resolve the issue.	1
	i have sent documents to kindle for delivery to my dx, used the drag & drop file transfer, and downloaded books from the kindle bookstore.	1
	all work fast and well.	1
	i am very impressed with the wireless delivery of both books and documents.	1
	the documents i sent were in pdf format and could not be converted (i knew this already).	1
	pdf documents formatted as standard letter sized documents, fonts at 9 or larger, are very clear and sharp.	1
	the dx is not ready to be used the way i want.	1
	the experimental pdf reader is too limited in capability to handle documents of different scales.	1
	items prepared in sizes larger than standard letter are reduced and too small to read for my old eyes.	1
	file handling looks good when connected by usb to a computer with normal folder layout capability.	1
	when the files show up on the dx's home page the files are no longer in folders.	1
	i currently have 154 pages of file listings with a total of 2452 documents loaded.	1
	the documents average 100 pages each.	1
	i have 2.73 of 2.74 gb loaded.	1
	the kindle dx is an excellent reader.	1
	it does everything advertised very well and i will use it that way.	1
	as a business document reader it is not yet ready.	1
	improvements to the pdf reader software are needed before it will serve my needs.      	1
	very poor pdf support.	1
	very big, very heavy.	1
	giving kindle as a gift.the kindle itself is a great product.	1
	the way amazon sells the product can be very deceiving.	1
	if you are purchasing it to give as a gift, be sure to make sure you mark in check out it is a gift otherwise all your credit card info in already stored in the kindle for future purchases.	1
	be sure that the recipient of the gift understands that they will now need to set up his/her own amazon account and then attach the kindle to that account with his/her credit card information.	1
	amazon is not very helpful or co operative on trying to straighten out the situation should it be given as a gift and not marked as such on the order.      	1
	not for heavy pdf viewing.	1
	unsatisfactory response from amazon customer service.	1
	so close, and yet so far.	1
	disappointment!.kindle dx is advertised for college students and the e-reader that can save news papers.	1
	that is mainly due to its' built in pdf format.	1
	however, there is no zoom capability to enlarge tables and charts; the pdf fonts can't be adjusted.	1
	thus, at this time, dx is just a bigger kindle2 with more memory.	1
	for that, i am not paying $540 (with cover).	1
	if you are a college student or fully functioning pdf is important to you, this product is not for you.	1
	ray      	1
	good concept but too many flaws.i had my kindle dx for about 2 weeks and here's what i feel about this product:the good: the e-ink screen is the best among all other similar e-book readers.it works very well (display fine, and can change font size, etc.)	1
	with native amazon books that i purchased.free sprint 3g network/text browser is wonder to have for checking basic webs on the road.the bad:the weight of the dx is little too heavy for some long reading (about 1.8 pounds), you need strong hands :).pdf file support is minimum, you can only read, search text and goto pages.	1
	bad choice for pdf users.no good ways to organize your files by folders, it can get messy if you have many books in the device.no touch screen support, which the new sony e-reader supports.	1
	i think it will be great for highlighting and adding notes on the fly.web browsing feature is still experimental, and not very useful with rendering non-mobile web pages.	1
	also, you don't know when amazon will discontinue the free 3g network from spring due to cost reasons.the ugly:no support for unicode text/pdf files!!	1
	you can't display other languages except english.	1
	there're os hacks that may get this feature to work, but it is dangerous and not officially supported.software update/new features are not likely be added by amazon, which means very little hope to see pdf zoom and other simple features to be added by amazon.screen saving feature automatically kick in within 10 minutes and there's no way that you can disable or change the timing on dx!!!	1
	bad design if you want to study and use dx at the same time..pdf support is very poor!	1
	most of the pdf files are too small to be readable on dx (yes, the fonts is still too small), and the only way to zoom the pdf file is to rote the screen by 180, which is super un-friendly to navigate or turn pages.	1
	i strongly recommend user to not buy dx for pdf purpose or you'll be wasting your money!!	1
	the support for pdf is just not there yet.. over all, good concept product that is far from maturity.	1
	no need to wasting your $500 on it yet.	1
	i must give amazon credit for bring this to the mass market and encourage competitions.	1
	i enjoyed my kindle dx for 2 weeks now, but i will return it shortly mainly for the above reasons.	1
	excellent!	1
	like an oversized ipod: but 50 years more advanced!.i love it!	1
	i own a lot of electronic devices and this is by far the best one.	1
	it was only $22 for next day air and i'm glad i got it faster.	1
	the black leather holder made by amazon is chic and has a magnetic closure.	1
	i get samples and complete novel in much less than 60 seconds.	1
	i love how one can rotate the kindle and the unit automatically re-orients itself.	1
	it is completely seamless, as the welcome letter from owner of amazon intended.	1
	much easier to read from because you are not reading left page and right page and adjusting yourself: everything is in front of you.	1
	i forget that i am reading from this device and get lost in the author's words.	1
	i cannot say that about any other device.	1
	i know when i'm using a laptop, dvd player, cell phone, etc.	1
	the kindle is just like reading from a hard cover novel.	1
	if i want to rest my eyes for a few minutes, i just press the text to speech and listen!	1
	when my eyes start getting tired at the end of the day, i simply increase the font!	1
	solid construction, good price, excellent device!	1
	the battery lasts a long time on a charge.	1
	in fact, i have been reading for three days with it since it arrived and i still have 90% battery life!	1
	i've saved $40 already by buying the kindle versions of 2 books, instead of paying the newly released hard cover price!	1
	thank you, amazon!      	1
	kindle dx a piece of junk!.	1
	the $500 paper weight.a few days ago i got my kindle dx in the mail.	1
	great!	1
	just in time for a 2 month trip to europe.	1
	three days into the trip it died.	1
	we have been big kindle users for the last year, despite the reliability issues.	1
	we are currently on our 3rd original kindle in one year, we have family members who are both on their second.	1
	we had high hopes for an improvement in this area with the dx but it is just more of the same.	1
	the bigger issue is that amazon refuses to ship the replacement overseas leaving me with a $500 paper weight.	1
	my only options are to ship it back to a friend in the us, then get amazon to ship the kindle to my friend, then have the friend ship it back here.	1
	while i loved the device for the 3 days it worked, i am furious at the reliability issues.	1
	the big reason to have this is to travel with but the reliability is just not at a point where you can count on in working for you.	1
	amazon is a great company, and the kindle and kindle store is a great concept, but i think amazon should have left the consumer electronics business to the pro's and teamed up with sony.	1
	i am sure i will not like the e-reader one tenth as much as the kindle but at least it will turn on.      	1
	still needs to mature, but very good for a first release product..	1
	my first and second purchase of the dx.	1
	wow.	1
	a bit too expensive however worth it for some readers.this kindle version is a bit too expensive however if you primarily read newspapers, magazines or text books, the larger screen is probably worth it over the .	1
	however, note that the kindle dx is not nearly as easy to travel with as it's more bulky to place into a bag or purse.	1
	instead of being like carrying around a paperback, it's akin to carrying around a regular sized notepad or clipboard; not something most would be comfortable doing on a day to day basis.	1
	also, cuddling up with a novel on the kindle dx may not be as comfortable generally because it doesn't fit in your hands as nicely as the smaller model-when reading lying down, it's more difficult to hold for instance.	1
	after using and comparing both models, i prefer the 6' kindle for the lower price, and better convenience in almost every way but i read mostly books and few newspapers, magazines or textbooks.	1
	i can still read those on my 6' kindle with no problem however i would have a problem using and carrying around the larger kindle.	1
	i am therefore returning the kindle dx.      	1
	pdf support can be made much better through firmware update.i bought the kindle dx primary because of its pdf-friendly screen size.	1
	i have a sizable pdf collection that i'm eager to read on the dx.	1
	however, while the pdf support is generally working, there are obvious omissions.	1
	i believe these can be fixed easily by firmware updates.	1
	1. page selection.	1
	right now it takes about 10 clicks to simply go to page 123: menu, down, enter, alt, 1, alt, 2, alt, 3, enter.	1
	considering that pdf view on the dx doesn't support other navigation options to begin with, this is seriously flawed.	1
	why can't i start hitting the (shared) number keys and have the dx intelligently figure out that i just typed a number and probably want to go to that page?	1
	at the very least, why do i have to hit alts when i am already in the go to page dialog box and therefore it's absolutely certain that i'm not going to type letters?	1
	2. contrast.	1
	pdfs not optimized for kindle display (which is most of them out there) often have fonts that are small and/or not pure black.	1
	these turn out to be rendered as various shades of gray and have horrible contrast on the dx.	1
	can i override that rendering and ask for highest contrast instead?	1
	both options shouldn't be terribly difficult to implement and do not introduce significant usability problems.	1
	in fact, these flaws have been mentioned on the web ever since the dx first came out.	1
	please address them!      	1
	merry christmas to me ....i coveted the kindle dx for several weeks before christmas, when i received it as a gift from my husband.	1
	i kept visiting amazon, comparing features between the smaller and larger product, dreaming of how i'd put it to use, checking out the books to make sure my favorite authors were represented, etc.	1
	i was afraid i'd be disappointed, because i'd never actually physically seen one, but ... i absolutely love it!	1
	i make the text a little larger to compensate for my deteriorating mid-range eye sight, so i can read for hours at a time.	1
	the contrast is wonderful and i don't feel like i'm looking at a computer, which i didn't want since i do it all day.	1
	some say they forget it's not a book.	1
	i can't say that, but i can say the difference doesn't bother me.	1
	the features i really enjoy:  the ability to instantly have a book i want and begin to read it immediately; relatively inexpensive new releases; the opportunity to try different authors at little to no cost; having so many books at my fingertips in such a compact space (for travel and home); the built in dictionary that's so easy to use and the intuitive ease of the buttons.	1
	i read so fast that when i travel i never have enough space to bring as many books as i need to keep me happy, so this is the perfect solution.	1
	i'll also be happy to have them organized instantly by author instead of having them scattered, piled and boxed all over the house.	1
	enhancements i would like:  ability to categorize into books that are read/unread without archiving books i'm temporarily finished with, a little less glare with my reading light.	1
	other than the enhancements i've suggested, there's nothing i don't love about the kindle dx.	1
	i haven't used the download feature for pdf documents, etc., so i can't speak to that.	1
	but for what i want - pleasure reading - it's perfect.      	1
	best technology i own next to my iphone!.	1
	the dx and the skeptic.	1
	viewing landscape pdf files.	1
	a device for bad eyes.	1
	with no folders or tags, this device is frustratingly crippled..	1
	best christmas present ever!	1
	!.	1
	better then sony reader 505.i have sony reader 505 for 7 months before kindle dx arrival.	1
	the dx is two time heavier and bigger, so it took me some time to feel comfortable to read.	1
	after a month and half using, in comparison with sony reader 505, i found following: - the kindle font is better for reading- the google, wiki and dictionary availability is a big advantage over sony (for me)- bigger screen- wireless internet is a plus, especially when you are waiting for long hours at the airport  - two times heavier and more expensive- no zoom or over flow for pdf files i am reading a lot, especially non-fiction and news; even with good laptop and very high resolution screen, my eyes became restrained after 30' reading.	1
	though e-ink does not have good contrast as paper print, it is ok for me.	1
	with good light i can read whole day without a problem.	1
	in my opinion, currently kindle is the best compromise for avid reader between laptop and print out.      	1
	sexy idea but poor battery life and somewhat crappy user experience.i purchased the kindle dx to:1. replace the reams of paper i carry with client docs, research and project materials2.	1
	make electronic annotations to save time and transition from idea to action3.	1
	take as many books on my travels as possible without the overweight luggage issue the good:* reading on the kindle screen is as gentle and impressive as advertised.	1
	* the auto-rotation of material isn't quite as smooth or responsive as my iphone, but it works.	1
	* usb connection was simple, no software needed* pre-purchased 25 books from the kindle store and within minutes of opening the box i was ready to go* the power supply/usb cord are sturdy and well designed* mp3 playback was decent, with and without headphones; will definitely work in a pinch* document conversion and delivery to kindle was smooth and simple* adjusting text sizes for comfort was smooth and intuitive the bad:* battery life isn't as robust as i'd hoped.	1
	'read for days' the description says.	1
	i got 2 books worth before the battery crapped out with the wireless on, for a total of 12 hours reading.	1
	* i find the placement of buttons and the joystick-nub less than comfortable with slow responsiveness and odd scale.	1
	* navigating the kindle store is equivalent to a crappy book store in a b-market airport (call me a user-experience snob i suppose)* it doesn't support pdf files as well as i expected.	1
	in fact, many of them won't open at all....	1
	frustrating!	1
	* i should have read more closely, but annotation isn't supported for pdf files either which kills my original idea of reducing drag between reading things and taking action on them* no way to organize material other than the default list sorts of author, title, freshness which means my very large library is horrible to navigate* the 'read to you' feature is terrible; herky-jerky even on the slowest speed so i found it hard to actually process what i was hearing* no protective sleeve or shell in the box; you have to purchase separately (imho @ this price should be included)* material is not always cheap unless you stick to the 'best sellers lists' which tend to lean toward crap  bottom line: i'm conflicted about the purchase.	1
	while i really like the portability of material, it doesn't totally meet my needs to interact with that material and the awkward usability issues are disappointing.	1
	in terms of immediate gratification, the kindle dx delivers purchases in seconds which gets high marks in my book.	1
	and in terms of battery life, 12 hours isn't enough for me with the travel schedule i keep - that would barely get me through a transatlantic flight.	1
	looks like a few more battery tests are in order.      	1
	exactly what a student needs..since there have been many reviews regarding its capabilities and such, i will try and provide a student's point of view.	1
	pros: 1. i am a biomedical science and biomathematics enthusiast.	1
	i read articles ranging from nejm to applied mathematics and i find that the kindle dx lives up to its descriptions.	1
	the pdf files come out beautifully and even if one were to not rotate, the two column text are still legible.	1
	2. textbook viewing: i read physiology texts as well as heavy equation filled texts as well and find that both are very well displayed on the kindle dx provided that they are real pdf files.	1
	even if the files are not formatted correctly, the text comes out great when rotated to landscape mode.	1
	3. size: despite the other reviewers saying that the kindle dx is slightly on the heavy side, i believe that the weight distribution is well put together.	1
	also, a little weight makes it feel...more sturdy perhaps.	1
	;)4. so if you are a science student wanting to spend some money to get the kindle dx, your investment here will surely benefit you.	1
	i have been waiting for such a device to come out for years and finally...a step into the future.	1
	cons: 1. i have have nothing bad to say thus far, but i do have some things that i thought i should mention.2.	1
	the lack of the ability to store files in folders is a slight problem that can easily be overcome by a little clever naming.	1
	(like how some reviewers proposed) i hope amazon will provide an update, but i wouldn't hold my breath.3.	1
	the price is a little steep.	1
	it will put a dent in a wallet of a poor college student.	1
	but work a few more hours and you will be a part of the kindle dx hype.	1
	conclusion: the kindle dx is something that i have always wanted.	1
	although, a little pricey, i think it is a good investment if one has the money to put into it.	1
	the functions are very close to how they are described by amazon and all in all it was a great investment.	1
	i hope this review helped someone out there who are debating whether the kindle dx will be useful for a student.	1
	good luck to you all!	1
	and have fun with your purchase!      	1
	frozen screen renders kindle dx useless.while traveling with kindle dx in a case purchased from amazon my kindle dx froze.	1
	per amazon, because there are diagonal lines on the screen the screen must have been damaged.	1
	i insisted the screen was not damaged.	1
	they offered a replacement for $255.00.	1
	i am appalled there is no other option for a very expensive product.	1
	how many others have had this problem?	1
	my wife has the kindle ii and travels extensively with it with no problems.	1
	i will have to try another product-done with kindle.      	1
	fails to deliver for academic purposes.today i returned my kindle.	1
	i played with the device for about 20 days.	1
	i really wanted to like it but my experience was disappointing.	1
	these are some of the reasons: my main purpose was to use pdf formatted journal articles and other material.	1
	pdf capability is one of the most advertised features of this device, and since it failed to deliver in that and some other respects.	1
	1. pdf text rendering is not as sharp as when it displays kindle format books.	1
	i don't care about zooming, as i like to see the whole page in the screen, but the text is simply too dim.	1
	it is the same even for high quality pdf's.	1
	2. pdf's cannot be searched, neither can i use the built-in dictionary.	1
	it is just a static, greyish image of a page with little contrast.	1
	3. pdf text cannot be highlighted.	1
	it can be bookmarked but it is no good as you cannot tell why you bookmarked a page.	1
	in this sense, it fails to replace printed research material for ease of reach, browsing and note-taking.	1
	the other reasons i did not like the product are: 1. extremely, annoyingly slow browser.	1
	it is simply not useful.	1
	i don't know if the price reflects fees for free internet connection and if it does, it is a waste of money for me.	1
	i am constantly in a wi-fi territory, a wi-fi modem would be just fine and actually better when travelling internationally or to areas without 3g service.	1
	my ipod touch could download a few free kindle books via wi-fi.	1
	in my view and experience, 3g was useless and inefficient.	1
	kindle with a fast internet (a fast wi-fi internet) could make this device much more valuable.	1
	2. this point is not specifically about dx but generally about kindle concept and its implementation.	1
	i did not care about downloading books from amazon.com; i continue to buy my books in good old fashioned way and form.	1
	(and amazon is always my first choice for buying paper books.)	1
	but the idea of deleting books remotely is simply too scary.	1
	amazon needs to offer a choice for those who would like to keep paper copies of their books but still interested in an additional electronic copy through bundled offers.	1
	i am not comfortable to spend 10 dollars for digits that can be lost or remotely deleted and more importantly that can only be read in kindle devices or little ipods.	1
	used books are pretty inexpensive.	1
	so the idea that kindle is going to save you money doesn't make much sense.	1
	you break your kindle, and your books are suddenly much more expensive than paper ones as you must buy a new one to access your books.	1
	3. the lack of folders is a serious mistake that needs to be immediately addressed.	1
	if the device can hold 3500 books, how do you organize them?	1
	4. other language dictionaries would be helpful.	1
	this device would be a good tool to read a foreign language book with built-in dictionaries.	1
	5. i found screen savers annoying.	1
	there must be a tool to deactivate them.	1
	the device has a promise but so far it hasn't delivered it.	1
	i am turning to conventional and convenient paper options now and would wait to see improvements.	1
	hopefully the price will get better then with more competition. 	1
	did you read the terms of service?	1
	?.before i'm getting to the real issue of this review, i'd like to express that amazon is my favorite site to buy books and music.	1
	being an engineer who travels a lot, the kindle would be a very useful device, besides that it's just cool.however, i will never buy the kindle, because of amazon's outrages terms of service!!!	1
	i learned this morning that they actually dared to delete bought copies of books, ironically orwell's 1984 and animal farm.	1
	this is the best proof that i'm perfectly right to stay away from this device.	1
	when i buy something, it's mine!	1
	here's the outrages part of the terms of service:  changes to service.	1
	amazon reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time, and amazon will not be liable to you should it exercise such right.	1
	termination.	1
	your rights under this agreement will automatically terminate without notice from amazon if you fail to comply with any term of this agreement.	1
	in case of such termination, you must cease all use of the software and amazon may immediately revoke your access to the service or to digital content without notice to you and without refund of any fees.	1
	amazon's failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of its rights.	1
	if amanzon changes the terms of sevice and remove drm from the kindle, i will buy it right away.       	1
	the kindle dx is much heavier..it's bigger.	1
	it's easier to read.	1
	the screen is much sharper.	1
	and the unit is much, much heavier.	1
	i am a big, strong dude, but when i held the unit for the first time, the initial words out of my mouth were, 'wow, that's heavy.'	1
	every time i pick the thing up, the first thought that comes to my mind is, 'wow, that's heavy.'	1
	maybe it's just the way the unit is balanced, who knows?	1
	it feels to me, very similar to my macbook air, which is feather-light for a laptop, but ... well, heavy for a kindle.	1
	it's great.	1
	it's big.	1
	it's cool.	1
	it's heavy.      	1
	having my books back.i was gifted the new dx by my sister.	1
	i just got it last monday and i hae to tell you no gift has ever meant so much to me.	1
	i am a voracious reader, and due to failing sight as well as lack of room when i relocated to the states from canada i had to leave behind a huge collection of books.	1
	books have always been a refuge for me friom the time i was very young, when my mother got me a librairy card she opened a door to all the worlds that i could never go to, the ladies at the local librairy became like second family, hehe.	1
	with the dx i can have almost all of the lovely stories that i rememebr from my younger days as well as new things from up and coming writers that i like.	1
	i hae problems grasping things (arthritis), but the dx is very easy for me to use and with the ability to chnage the font i can read easily with out the eye strain that had given me such bad head aches.	1
	like my computer this is another window to the world outside and it makes my life richer every time i pick it up.	1
	i recommend it to anyone who like reading but is short on storage or who just wants to be able to have their favorites at the flick of a switch.	1
	yes they don't have every book but i am sure that will continue to grow in scope as time goes by, where else are you going to able to store 3,000 plus books in an area the aise of a magazine?	1
	i really like the rotation thing as well if i get tired of holding it upright i just open out the cover (i got the nice leather one) and stand it up on it's own.	1
	i plug it in in the morning when i set down to answer my mail and by the time i am through it is all charged up and ready to take me to new places, as well as old places, and everything in between.. 	1
	fantabulous!.i won't provide a feature-by-feature examination of the dx (there are some excellent reviews that do so, already)... but i will add my two cents for those contemplating this purchase: i chose the dx because of the larger screen size.	1
	it is perfect for reading large-format documents (e.g., journal articles, newspapers/magazines, etc.).	1
	the pdf reader works well -- i use it to read medical/scientific journal articles.	1
	they look exactly as if printed (or viewed on the computer), and now i can carry a whole bunch with me wherever i go.	1
	my wife is especially thankful, since now i don't accumulate stacks of articles on my desk anymore.	1
	the one downside to the pdf viewer is that the font size is not controllable.	1
	this is understandable, since the kindle is trying to preserve and respect the formatting of the pdf.	1
	fortunately, however, you can just rotate the device (to landscape mode) to zoom-in on tables or figures that you'd like to see close-up.	1
	usb uploading is a snap.	1
	you can even drag entire folders of documents, although the kindle won't show titles nested in folders (a desired feature that i hope they add in the future), but rather just lists everything by title.	1
	you can get around this handicap by naming your pdf files appropriately, so as to group related documents when sorted by title or author.	1
	the rudimentary web browser works surprisingly well for predominantly text-based web sites, such as wikipedia or various blogs.	1
	one surprise was the artwork that appears on-screen as a screensaver when the device is not use for 10 minutes or so.	1
	this includes portraits of literary authors and some nice artwork.	1
	it's quite nice to return to your device and see a zodiacal chart or an illuminated manuscript.	1
	sliding the power switch quickly returns you to your document where you left off.	1
	overall, i am ***extremely*** happy with my kindle dx and look forward to using it for years to come.	1
	i highly recommend it for other avid readers out there.	1
	(if you're the type of person who packs too many books or magazines or newspapers or journals on a trip because you don't want to chance being without something to read, just in case there's time or the interest strikes you, then the kindle is for you!)	1
	great job, amazon! 	1
	the definitive electronic book... finally!.although i was an early adopter of the original kindle, i've eagerly anticipated amazon's kindle dx.	1
	the original device was, and is, well-suited for light reading of non-serious material, but its small screen size and lack of pdf support made it mostly a recreational device.	1
	i quickly realized that any serious technical book still worked better in physical form.	1
	that, combined with the original kindle's inability to handle pdfs in a usable form (the conversion left a lot to be desired), made me look at other ereaders, particularly the iliad irex.	1
	unfortunately, the irex, at above $800, was still a work-in-progress, with serious deficiencies in terms of functionality and reliability, and i didn't want to be an alpha tester of a device that might never be finished.	1
	amazon's announcement of the large-format kindle dx with native pdf support seemed like the answer... so i plunked down the money for a dx and the amazon case and got on the waiting list.	1
	why would you want native pdf support?	1
	the small kindles support pdfs file via translation; you send a pdf document to amazon and they convert it to the kindle's azw format and send it back to you, either to your desktop email account (free) or directly to your kindle ($0.10 per document).	1
	however, if your document is anything more than simple text, formatting and imagery are mangled.	1
	what you get is readable but not nearly as readable as a kindle document that was specifically prepared for the device.	1
	this is an inherent restriction caused by the difference between a document file structure that is meant to preserve formatting (pdf) and one that is meant to allow for text flow despite screen or font size concerns (azw).	1
	the result was that you couldn't practically use either the original or 2nd gen kindles for reading even reasonably complex pdf documents.	1
	having an integral native pdf reader on the new kindle dx solves this problem and opens up a huge world of documents to the kindle owner.	1
	i've had the kindle dx for about a day now, and it's everything i was looking for.	1
	pdfs render beautifully, and kindle azw documents render even better than they did on the original kindle due to the larger screen size and 16-tone grey scale capability.	1
	the large screen really elevates the new dx into something more than a convenient device for light reading.	1
	the kindle dx shows the true utility of an electronic reader for the first time.	1
	it's what the kindle should have been from the start.	1
	what has improved?	1
	performance is better, particularly the screen refresh rate.	1
	the new button design means not turning pages accidentally anymore (although i wish they'd kept buttons on both sides of the device for us left-handers).	1
	i don't like not having an sd card slot on the device, nor do i like not being able to change the battery without sending the device back to amazon.	1
	being able to turn the whispernet modem on and off via software (menu item) is scads better than having to move a switch.	1
	the web browser's 'desktop' mode makes the browser very usable, especially when combined with the rotation feature.	1
	speaking of rotation, the ability to rotate the device and view documents in either landscape or portrait mode is killer.	1
	text-to-speech works well, but i have yet to try it for actually 'reading' (listening to) a document while doing something else, e.g., driving, to see if it is really useful or just a checklist feature.	1
	the amazon cover (extra charge) is way above the original kindle's flimsy cover; it actually holds the device securely, protects the screen, yet is easy to open (beware of the magnetic latch around external hard drives or near the bottom of your laptop).	1
	okay, so now i have two kindles.	1
	my wife asked me why i need two, a good question.	1
	my answer is, the small kindles are great for light reading... the latest fiction novel, public-domain classics, etc., but they're useless for pdfs or more serious reading such as technical books because the screen size is too small and images, formulas, etc., don't display well.	1
	the kindle dx is great for any type of reading and shines with pdfs and more serious books, yet it is considerably heavier than the original kindle (i'd say twice as heavy, if not more so) and not as convenient to stuff in a carry-on bag.	1
	i've already moved all of the technical books i own over to the dx, as well as many pdf documents.	1
	i had decided to not buy any serious books for my kindle, using it only for light reading... but the new kindle dx has changed my mind.	1
	the experience of reading a technical book is as good or better than the physical book, and that is something that could not be said about the smaller kindles.	1
	if i had to own just one electronic reading device, the choice is obvious: the kindle dx.	1
	amazon has gotten it right; the kindle dx finally fulfills the 'book' paradigm in an electronic device.      	1
	amazing, but not for me.	1
	love it!	1
	love it!	1
	love it!.the kindle dx is my first ebook reader.	1
	i received it on the 11th.	1
	i travel a lot and i love the amount books i can carry now!	1
	right now on my kindle dx i have 16mb of various pdf's for work, 1 bible and 1 study bible, 3 novels, 1 blog, 2 trial newspaper subscriptions (i think i've used about 1% of the space available).	1
	i've tried out the 6' sony and the 6' kindle 2. both nice.	1
	i'm very glad i waited for the 9.7' screen!!!!!	1
	16 grey scales, easy to adjust font size, great contrast-- very easy on the eyes, unlike a computer screen.	1
	oh, and the screen rotation is fantastic!	1
	i also bought the kindle cover.	1
	it is very sturdy, offers good protection, and the connection points seem very strong so the dx shouldn't detatch.	1
	it also makes holding the dx much easier for reading.	1
	i highly recommend it --despite the cost.	1
	some questions i had before buying were; can you upload pdf's and other documents for free?	1
	yes.	1
	i've transferred several pdf's from my macbook via usb.	1
	with native pdf support, they look great.	1
	you can also search the pdf's using kindle's built-in search function.	1
	pdf's protected with drm-like protections aren't viewable i have been told.	1
	amazon's kindle site says you can email yourself other documents that need to be converted (word doc, text files) through a free kindle address to your email.	1
	haven't tried it yet though.	1
	it would be nice if you could manage the content more like computer files.	1
	basically be able to group certain works together (i.e.	1
	work folder that contains pdf fils, word documents, a reference book or trade publication.	1
	and a leisure folder with a novel, magazine subscription, pdf file, etc) i've purchased a few kindle books and few trial subscriptions to blogs and newspapers.	1
	there's a wide difference between publishers in the ease of navigation within a document or book.	1
	some are easier  than others to move from section-to-section when you are navigating between articles in a newspaper or moving from book-to-book or verse-to-verse in the bible, for example.	1
	my only gripe is the cost of kindle books.	1
	i feel kindle books should be a fraction of the cost of the cheapest books available in paper form.	1
	particularly the older releases that are available in paperback i'd also like to permanently delete some archived kindle books that were free & no longer want.	1
	haven't figured out how to do that yet.	1
	hope this helps!       	1
	finally!	1
	pdfs!.i got the kindle 2 mostly so that i can portably carry pdf versions of technical manuals i use on the set in movie production.	1
	i used to do this on a laptop, but with the kindle 2, pdfs were at best difficult to manage.	1
	in fact, i was never successful at loading the kindle 2 with larger manuals.	1
	so, the first thing i did when i unwrapped the kindle dx was load a manual that i was never able to get on the kindle 2 and to my surprise, this was so simple, a kindergarden caveman could do it...  also, to my surprise, the kindle dx displays the pdf properly and very sharply.	1
	i used to get lost in pdfs on the old kindle.	1
	no more!	1
	brilliant!	1
	pages=pages.	1
	now if cole-haan would just hurry up and make a nice pebble grain leather cover with hinges for the dx all would be right in the world.      	1
	best way to read and study!.i just got my kindle dx and i am in love with it.	1
	not only is it so easy to move from book to book, not to mention all the free stuff available, but i am studying spanish and love all of the material that is available for me.	1
	do buy the 'cook book'; it is worth the money.	1
	it will answer all of your questions about how to download, surf or other free sites available.	1
	the only thing i would like amazon to add is default dictionaries in other languages...but you can just download one and use it on the side.	1
	i think this dx is worth the money, for anyone who is an avid reader.	1
	you will no longer have to carry stacks of books or wait to read your favorite blog.        	1
	great reader.i own the latest-generation kindle and kindle dx; i purchased the dx primarily for the improved screen real estate, for reading textbooks and technical whitepapers.	1
	it is an excellent, sturdy device with a big, easy-to-read screen.	1
	all features work as advertised.	1
	there will be no shortage of praise for the feature set... large screen, 3g wireless, auto-rotate (which i disabled because it rotates too easily when you shift position), etc.	1
	the battery life is spectacular, as it is with the smaller kindle; with the wireless radio turned off, i have been reading a couple hours per day for about 2 weeks and the battery is still at 70%.	1
	the smaller one lasts even longer, but that's very much expected with the larger display on the dx.	1
	a few nitpicks, and these, only relative to the smaller kindle:1. prev/next page buttons on both sides of the device.	1
	very thoughtful feature of the smaller kindle; you can hold it in either hand so that you can sit / lay in any position, hold the reader in either hand, and be able to flip pages one-handed.	1
	the form factor of the dx allows for buttons on both sides; why take them out?2.	1
	numeral buttons.	1
	there's plenty of room on the dx for separate numerals as a top row; but you have to press 'alt' on this one, like a slider phone.	1
	rather annoying if you intend to make notes with the thing, which is really one of the primary differentiators between this and other readers.	1
	again, with the form factor of the dx, there is ample room for another row of buttons at the top; why not just give us number buttons?3.	1
	price.	1
	amazon knows what it's doing, and this product occurs in a market space with very limited competition.	1
	the irex digital reader 1000 seems to be the only real competition in the 10' screen arena, and it is dramatically more expensive.	1
	however, 6' readers are readily available, fully-outfitted with features and functions, in the $250-300 range, including kindle.	1
	the dx represents a 100% markup for a device that contains all of the same features and functions of the smaller kindle, other than the larger screen.	1
	the e-ink panel, and the cost of manufacturing the larger case, certainly represents some increase over kindle, but not 100%.	1
	a majority of that price increase is paying for brand name, design, marketing... a la sony vaio or mac devices.	1
	if this were to hit it out of the ballpark, the price point should be a reasonable increase over the base kindle ($100-$150), but should be accessible in a reasonable e-reader range.	1
	to bring some perspective: at this price point, you have paid as more for a grayscale e-reader as a loaded netbook or basic laptop w. 15' screen and optical drive would cost; and you can read e-books on laptops & netbooks just as well.	1
	it is my sincere hope that some greater competition within the 10' reader market space occurs in the coming year and forces some sanity on the pricing of these things... all of that said, this is a very nice device.	1
	i paid that premium to get the larger screen, and do not regret it.	1
	it's slender, light, sturdy, easy to read, with great battery life and an attractive form factor.	1
	it is a well-designed and well-constructed device.	1
	if you want a larger e-reader, and can miss $500 and not worry too much about what else that could buy you... i would assert that this is a great way to spend it!	1
	this is wonderful!.	1
	five stars for service -kindle dx.	1
	in love with kindle dx.	1
	dx after 3 months.	1
	good choice for travel and home.	1
	please please please add a file system!.4 stars, not 5 because lack of a file system.	1
	the kindle dx looks like a vast improvement on the original kindle.	1
	but where is the file system?	1
	you are offering vast storage capacity with no way to organize the titles.	1
	please add a file system!	1
	i like the kindle dx.	1
	the increased display size and increased contrast of print to background are very attractive.	1
	this item is somewhat pricey, but i have a bad habit of buying books regardless of price.	1
	please add a file system!	1
	what operating system are you using?	1
	i have written programs for the palm pilot and you can have a file system on that small device.	1
	cell phones have a file system to organize different kinds of data.	1
	please add a file system so i can buy one of these things.	1
	please please please add a file system!      	1
	kindle dx reviewd from a students perspective.	1
	cool reading device.first of all, i want to say that the kindle dx experience is great.	1
	but do not expect this device to behave like a handheld device or a small computer.	1
	it is not a computer: it is a reading device.	1
	so, think twice before buying it : you may first really wonder why you would spend more than $400 for such a device.the kindle dx has a very good form factor for reading more than the books you bought : the screen size is big enough to allow you to read technical papers or powerpoint-converted documents.	1
	and at last the acrobat format is fully functional : plug the kindle to your computer and drop whatever you like !note that the kindle dx is a nice piece of compact technology.	1
	but its weight (same as a best seller big book) will certainly push you to put it on your legs after few minutes of holding it.	1
	this is especially true when you want to write something with its keyboard: the weight will give you hard time to wear it at the same time typing text.	1
	but the keyboard is small and good quality.	1
	it doesn't take much space, which is a good point: the rest being used by the screen.	1
	despite the fact that many features are missing, kindle dx is such a very nice device.	1
	the excellent reading experience, the free access to internet and the freedom of reading any of your pdf/text document makes this device worth its price, if... you are used to spend of lot of time reading documents and browsing for information.	1
	you could even take a big advantage of this device without buying any e-book...let's just hope that amazon will provide a firmware update with some missing features as soon as possible.	1
	"very good features :-	display size for reading."	1
	"perfect size for technical documents-	e-ink : being able to access information and read you documents outdoor is such a pleasure."	1
	"-	pdf documents."	1
	technical papers (like white papers from research areas etc.)	1
	"are perfectly rendered.-	web browser : either 'basic mode' or 'desktop mode' are nice."	1
	blog-style sites (ubergizmo...) or wiki sites (wikipedia) are the most compliant.	1
	other sites are still working pretty well.	1
	i can check my google emails and write short answers (long answers slows down the refresh, because of the e-ink technology display) without any issue.	1
	"missing features, or features that would be most welcome:-	no grouping of pdf documents."	1
	even if you copied your pdf documents in various sub-folders, they appear as one single list.	1
	"it can become a problem if you stored thousands of them -	no selection within a pdf document."	1
	"as opposed to a ebook or text file where you can highlight and lookup the word into the dictionary, pdf documents don't offer this feature at all.-	no annotations on highlighted text-	general search feature not working for pdf documents."	1
	text and books are indexed so that you can perform a global search and get the list of documents/books that contain your keywords.	1
	pdf documents aren't part of this search.	1
	"the only way to search in a pdf file is to first load it...-	no zoom in a pdf document; no way to change the size of letters."	1
	"the only way to zoom is to rotate the kindle (auto mode or by explicitly asking for the rotation...)-	no grouping of web-browser bookmarks."	1
	"again, this can become a real issue if you have many-	no synthetic voice for pdf documents... but i can understand that it can be a hard problem to solve."	1
	"especially if the pdf document contains equations and other crazy keywords !-	no way to browse mp3 files."	1
	"i would have loved to get this feature for a specific purpose : listen to recorded conferences while reading the slides (converted in pdf) !-	no picture viewer."	1
	although the display is in grayscale, i personally like this.	1
	"it gives an artistic touch (if you did a correct contrast setup and maybe post-processed the image with some patterns).-	no way to choose which image will be displayed when turned off."	1
	currently, the kindle display very nice images when off.	1
	"it would be cool if we could choose our own image... so the kindle would be usefull even when off : as a decoration in your living room :-) !-	no touch screen frustrations:-	although i didn't use it so much, yet... i got few random crashes (web browser, pdf document...)."	1
	"firmware update will help-	missing features when reading pdf documents : font size; indexed search; highlighting; lookup to dictionnary; zoom...-	no way to choose the mp3 from a list-	getting lost in the list of documents stored in the kindle."	1
	"after 20 documents uploaded, it becomes difficult to quickly access them.-	pdf load time can be long"	1
	i'm not certain that the dx is a vast improvement.this is my third kindle.	1
	i purchased my first the day that the kindle 1 went on sale.	1
	i loved it despite the fact that it was truly ugly and rather cheap looking.	1
	it was hardly revolutionary  but it was still a great device.	1
	i purchased and still have my kindle2.	1
	it is a vast improvement over the original kindle in footprint, speed, and functionality.	1
	it's terrific.	1
	it's compact and fits beautifully and comfortably in the hand.	1
	it's easy to pack away and when it's out of the cover, it actually fits in my pants pocket (when i'm wearing a good pair of pants!).	1
	then along comes the kindle dx.	1
	it's big and substantially heavier than the kindle 2--and that's about it.	1
	it is not really an improvement.	1
	the dx isn't really that great a device when compared to the kindle 2. the keyboard is essentially useless.	1
	i'm accustomed to entering lots of notes in books that i'm reading on my kindle.	1
	the keyboard on the dx is difficult to use and the keys are too widely spaced.	1
	you cannot comfortably hold the device and type on the keyboard.	1
	the dx is a bit better when looking at magazines and newspapers but not a big enough improvement to justify upgrading from a 2. perhaps when textbooks become more widely available the dx will be more attractive.	1
	the dx has an accelerometer.	1
	that's nice but not a big deal for me.	1
	you can view documents in landscape or rotate the device 180 degrees so that you left-handers can access the page turn buttons more easily but try typing on the keyboard while it's  upside-down.	1
	amazon is touting the dx's native pdf functionality.	1
	newsflash: it doesn't work that well.	1
	it's very inconsistent and navigating pdf documents is not even marginally easy or effective.	1
	i prefer amazon's conversion option of mailing the document to my kindle email address for conversion.	1
	it's worth the 10 cents per document that it costs.	1
	it isn't flawless but it is superior to 'native pdf'.	1
	all things considered, i would not have purchased the dx if i had had an opportunity to test drive it.	1
	i take my kindle2 when i travel and pretty much everywhere i go.	1
	it's a much better device for my lifestyle.	1
	i keep my dx at home and enjoy using it when i don't have to schlep it around.       	1
	wonderful.i will begin by saying as a parent of two college kids, i never spend money on myself in this amount.	1
	that out of the way, i am so pleased with my kindle dx.	1
	i especially love getting samples of books.	1
	this feature is extremely useful to me...since i used to spend a lot of time in a bookstore, trying to see if i'd like a certain book.	1
	the next best thing is the ability to get classic books i know and love for under 1 or 2 dollars.	1
	now if i recall a certain passage i love, it's right there.	1
	i doubt i will use the text to speech feature, much if at all, but the ability to change font size is really super.	1
	i am not tech savvy, so my kindle does things i haven't learned about yet, but my next purchase will be the kindle cookbook (i think that is what it is called.)	1
	i also find the kindle community boards quite useful and very friendly.	1
	one tiny drawback, but in my experience, not just a kindle related event.	1
	while reading in bed the other night, i fell asleep and the kindle bopped me right in my nose.	1
	no different than a big old hardcover, but thankfully the kindle is lighter!	1
	i feel like i will have many many years of pleasure with my purchase.	1
	i was over the guilt of the cost after the first week.	1
	steven williamson      	1
	great to have.after having guite a few problems with the first kindle dx i was sent, i can now say i am having a lot of fun with it.	1
	the first dx had some things wrong with it, mainly it would not go online.	1
	it had zero signal.	1
	having called amazon support and being told i was in an area that did not have a good signal, i was about ready to return it but then learned i could download the books to my computer and then transfer them to the dx.	1
	i decided that would be good enough for me, and i would also be able to listen to my audio books.	1
	since the audio books were the main reason for buying the kindle, i was ok with things.	1
	after calling amazon back on another question, i spoke with a new service tech.	1
	he was most concerned about my not having a signal.	1
	he said i should definitely have a signal.	1
	he had me go to a page and read off a bunch of numbers for me.	1
	he kept in contact by phone and it was determined there was something wrong with the kindle and a new one was being sent overnight shipping.	1
	thank you anthony b. for your caring and service.	1
	my new kindle works perfectly.	1
	i have a 4 bars connection which is about what i expected in my area.	1
	we have listened to audio books in the car on trips, and i have read several books.	1
	the hands free reading has been very helpful with my arthritis as sometimes it is quite painful for me to hold a regular book for long periods of time.	1
	i can lay the kindle on my lap and not have to hold it at all.	1
	the only downside i have found concerns my audio books.	1
	instead of telling me the author of the book, the kindle lists the narrator.	1
	i do not like this feature.	1
	i don't really care who is reading it, i want to know who wrote it.	1
	amazon says it is audibles problem, and audible says it is amazon's problem.	1
	so who ever's problem it is, i wish they would fix it.	1
	that is the only reason i did not give it 5 stars.      	1
	new kindle, losing sleep.i got my kindle dx for father's day, and had 70 copyright-free works in a day.	1
	(i highly recommend us grant's memoirs, if you've never tried.)	1
	mark twain, dickens, conan-doyle, burroughs, hg wells...i'm having a blast.	1
	the only purchase i've actually made so far is a navigable kjv bible.	1
	still a bit cumbersome, but getting easier to get around.	1
	i've got 47-year-old eyes, but find the dx screen easier to read in dim light than most print.	1
	i do wish there was a way to cut and paste, but more practice with the highlighting feature could cure me of that desire.	1
	i would also like a more obvious explanation of the web-use fee.	1
	i haven't tried that yet, though, since i'm usually near my computer.	1
	the built-in dictionary is cool, and the wikipedia uplink has been helpful for a couple of terms not in the oxford a.e.	1
	it's expensive, but it's nice to have the 'latest' device for once..and such a great wife.	1
	only knocks, the price, the web fee, and the late nights reading from my new toy.        	1
	wow - i'm a fan.i was prepared to be disappointed after reading some luke-warm customer and on-line reviews.	1
	to my delight, my new kindle dx has exceeded my expectations and i expect to be enjoying books, mags and the daily ny times on it for a long time.	1
	p l u s e sdesign better in the hand than it appears in pictures; i think if more folks could hold one prior to purchase, sales would be even better (sell out sooner and more often?).	1
	heft is solid but not uncomfortably heavy.	1
	page size is just right.	1
	keyboard unobtrusive.	1
	operating controls have nice feel, but don't actuate accidentally.	1
	overall impression is grace and elegance.screen in sunlight, it looks like print on paper--amazing.	1
	bright indoor light, equally fine.	1
	as expected, in dim light in bed, the contrast is washed out and text size may need to be increased for legibility.	1
	a nightstand  lamp directed onto the screen helps; i haven't needed a clip-on screen light.page turns very fast, no bother at all.	1
	another pre-buy concern dispelled in actual use.wireless fabulous for kindle store.	1
	not so great for web browsing, but for that i have iphone.kindle store fantastic organization, ease of search and navigation, teaser samples, free trial subscriptions... it is going to be way too easy to impulse buy, buy, buy faster than i can read!	1
	i compare it to the itunes store of which i am a great fan--i think the kindle store is more seductive and browsing there may be an even better experience.	1
	it comes very close to a pleasant trip to an actual bookstore, but everything is in stock!leather cover works well for me.	1
	protects the screen, folds out of the way unobtrusively, keeps device from sliding around on my lap.	1
	high quality and locks securely to kindle.	1
	$50 is a bit pricey, but value is there.	1
	n e u t r a loperating system not completely intuitive.	1
	although not bad either once mastered.	1
	i had to read the manual for some basic features.	1
	and it is a fairly lengthy manual.	1
	i'm not sure all the control buttons are required, and i frequently press the wrong one back vs. menu vs. stick vs. home.	1
	the features and menu layout are logical once the desired menu page is reached.	1
	i dunno, wonder how apple would have crafted the physical/software user interface.	1
	my ipod and iphone are more intuitive and consistent in operation.	1
	but none of it matters once underway in a book: next page and previous page work just fine.	1
	n o t   s o   g o o dpdf i had high hopes of putting some (many) reference documents for work on the kindle, and this in fact was a big reason i bought the dx.	1
	unfortunately, a well-formatted 8 1/2 x 11 layout is just too tiny to read on the kindle.	1
	improved but still a bit too tiny is turning screen to landscape, but then, as has been well-documented, the pagination is lost--no way to scroll up and down to center a page--and reading columns is very awkward.	1
	i don't see how highly designed textbooks are going to work out unless they're de-formatted to simple text.	1
	it is possible to word-search within documents which is great.	1
	and the margins are trimmed as promised.	1
	i think this may improve with software updates, perhaps enabling a column sequencer like iphone safari, or some other form of text expander.	1
	u n t r i e dkeyboard notes i had no trouble registering and customizing using the keyboard.	1
	i think the key feel is fine and the sym key ok. agree with others that i wouldn't want to type a paragraph, but a few sentences shouldn't be a problem.	1
	a w e s o m edictionary new oxford american is one of the best, and it is already installed, free and easily accessible.	1
	no longer any excuse for not looking up those obscure vocab-builders and weird geographic locations.easter eggs maybe not what you expected, but i find the screen savers of famous authors and book covers that appear when the device is put to sleep to be delightful.	1
	eight new ones and counting, don't know the total number.	1
	in summary, i think if you are intrigued by this device and read a high volume of current publications or even classics, and don't want to wait your turn on the library list, or especially like to keep several books going at a time but don't want to lug a giant sack of print and bindings, or wish to read new hard cover best sellers at paperback prices with instant delivery, or currently struggle to read the newspaper or a book with one hand while standing on the subway--give the kindle a try.	1
	it does achieve superbly its primary goal of disappearing as you become immersed in the text.	1
	no doubt technology will only get better, but i am very satisfied with my kindle as is and extremely happy that i took the plunge.      	1
	kindle dx arrives.	1
	impressions from a reader and radiologist.background:i used to be an avid reader, starting in grade school, through high school, and up through college.	1
	once i began medical school, time for pleasure reading went out the window.	1
	that trend continued throughout residency, until i purchased the kindle 1. since i got that device in mar 2008 (and continuing through the kindle 2 i got in feb 2009), i have read over 80 books, a mixture of fiction and non-fiction.	1
	the kindle has definitely re-ignited my interest in reading and made it fun again.	1
	i am a radiologist.	1
	to keep up with my profession, i need to read journal articles monthly.	1
	i usually read these in a .pdf format on a computer screen.	1
	occasionally, if it's an important article i'll print it, but usually i keep noteworthy articles on a directory on my desktop pc.	1
	the kindle dx seemed like the ideal solution for me when it was announced.	1
	i could still read books (with a larger screen), and keep and read my journal articles at my leisure on my kindle.	1
	thus, even though i had just purchased a kindle 2, i pre-ordered a dx.	1
	i've had the dx for a couple of weeks now, with pretty steady daily use.	1
	overall impression:i really like the dx, a lot.	1
	(in fact, amazon should be compensating me for the amount of free advertising i'm giving them by showing the dx off to anyone who will listen.)	1
	in most situations, i prefer it to the kindle 2, which i preferred over the kindle 1. i read pretty fast, and it's a real benefit to be able to have more words on the page, with a larger font, and still require fewer page turns than the kindle 2. i don't find the dx overly heavy.	1
	the dx cover is much heavier than the 2's, not just because of its size but also because of the magnets.	1
	if you take the dx out of its cover during extended reading sessions, it's very manageable - certainly easier to hold than the average hardcover, and easier than most paperbacks.	1
	i have found that i can set the dx on my treadmill or elliptical trainer and read fairly comfortably.	1
	the dx's size means i can set the font size larger and still require fewer page turns than the 2.the dx is a little more cumbersome to lug around, but it's not completely unmanageable.	1
	i could fit the 2 in my back pocket, but rarely did for fear of sitting on it.	1
	the dx won't fit into any pocket, but it's certainly at least as portable as any hardcover, and some paperbacks.	1
	pdf journal article reading:the .pdf formatting for radiology journal articles has so far worked pretty well.	1
	the page formatting thus far has been identical to what i see on my computer screen.	1
	the text with the .pdf in portrait mode is usually too small to read comfortably, but it's very readable while in landscape mode.	1
	image quality is surprisingly decent.	1
	it has usually garnered favorable impressions from the radiologists who've seen it.	1
	cross-sectional images, in particular, are usually easily interpretable on the dx (particularly if arrows are added).	1
	radiographs are harder, but frankly they're not all that great on the printed page either.	1
	one big complaint (already observed by others on amazon's boards), is that the pagination in landscape mode doesn't work.	1
	as you page through a document in landscape mode, you quickly get off of a 'top-half/bottom half' separation and start having part of the bottom of one page displayed with the top of the next.	1
	to reset this, you have to switch back to portrait mode, and then back to landscape mode (tedious).	1
	this should be fixed, and i can't imagine it would be difficult to do.	1
	another complaint is the lack of folder architecture.	1
	this is a frequent complaint, so i won't go into it too much here.	1
	it does seem a little silly to have a device with 4 gb of storage and no clear way to organize dozens (or hundreds) of documents beyond alphabetizing them.	1
	i end up copying and deleting articles using the usb cable, and will probably continue to do that until a better kindle software solution presents itself.	1
	the bottom line is that i can and do read radiology articles on my device.	1
	there are still a few quirks, but right now i think it's better than any other e-reader out there.	1
	that may change in a year or so... (yes, the printed journal itself or laser copies are probably still better quality, but that's missing the point of this review, no need to point this out.)	1
	device issues:wireless connectivity is good - on par with the kindle 2, which was decent.	1
	i get pretty good service in most metropolitan areas.	1
	again, one of the main benefits of the kindle is the ability to download any book you want when you want.	1
	using the experimental web browsing feature, webpages come up pretty quickly, and if you use the mobile links to popular sites (which are mostly text) they're really pretty useable.the gyroscope/auto rotation feature works ok, although i've found with the dx it isn't as useful as with an iphone.	1
	or maybe it doesn't work quite as well....i tend to read with the device flat, and it can get confused and randomly rotate the screen if it's slightly tilted off axis while flat.	1
	battery life is on par with the 2 - still excellent.	1
	i get about 2 weeks out of a full charge if i don't have the wireless modem on (which i usually don't).	1
	one big caveat - others have noted that having the auto rotation feature turned on will slowly drain battery life.	1
	because of this, in addition to the fact that i don't like having auto rotation on, means i simply manually rotate the page when i need to.	1
	keyboard is smaller than 2's, which is fine since it gives more space for the screen, and i don't use the keyboard much anyway.	1
	it is a little irritating to press function keys for the numbers, though.	1
	the dictionary look up feature is still awesome.	1
	if you like to read books that challenge your vocabulary, it's great to immediately get a definition without pulling out a dictionary and rifling through it.	1
	the screen quality is on par with the 2. in general, the font seems bolder and darker than the 2, independent of text size.	1
	picture quality is about the same.	1
	i don't use the text-to-speech or the mp3 features.	1
	they're the same as the 2, except there's a female text-to-speech voice on the dx.	1
	summary: pros:larger screen sizepdfs display wellimproved font qualityconvenience of book purchasing cons:slightly heavier and less portablepagination of pdfs in landscape mode doesn't work wellneeds folders (or better file organization/searching)price bottom line....as both an avid reader and a radiologist (and an early adopter, and a technophile), the dx has been a great device for me.	1
	i recommend any kindle to anyone who enjoys reading (technophile or not), and the dx to those who want the option of reading .pdfs and having a larger screen, with the sacrifice of some portability and price.	1
	finally a good pdf reader.overall, a good buy.	1
	there are a number of e-book readers out there from sony, to jetbook (see my other review), to irex, eslick, and obviously, the older versions of the kindle.	1
	one of the key features that i was looking for was the ability for the reader to read and process pdf documents.	1
	i would have liked other formats (word, xls, etc), but pdf is the bare minimum as many technical journals, work documents, etc are pdf formatted.	1
	i never felt comfortable with sending the document to amazon to be converted as i am worried about security and unlawful viewing of confidential documents by someone other than myself.	1
	with the dx, problem is solved!	1
	the large screen is great for documents that cannot be 'reformatted' - i.e.	1
	pdf.	1
	carrying it is a little difficult, but it is a price you pay for features you want.	1
	the device is thin and even weighted, so holidng it is not an issue.	1
	it is heavier than the smaller one, so you hand gets tired after about 30-minutes or so.	1
	reading newspapers such as the nyt is much easier on the dx than a smaller screen device as you can imagine, and you get used to the 'flicker' when you turn a page.	1
	the wireless - oh, the wireless; it is priceless.	1
	buy, view, read, and get the latest content is real-time without the need to sync.	1
	that was always a pain for me as i forget to sync or copy my files from one device to the next.	1
	you still need to connect to the device to your pc to copy things like pdf docs over, but that's ok.   what i don't like about the kindle are as follows (ordered of importance): - memory expansion to sizes of 16g+ is needed- would have liked bluetooth as an option to connect and copy files from my pc to the device.	1
	as far as i am concerned, you dont need to sync via wire anymore.	1
	- wireless is great, but it is not a general web browser.	1
	this can be a benefit if you are on the road.- color screen is a must - i heard that this will be the next version- price is little too much  i am happy with the dx - it was a good buy and i highly recommend.	1
	made the right choice with the dx.after reading many user reviews, i took the plunge and purchased the kindle dx.	1
	the original size never appealed to me because it seemed too small.	1
	i don't like to read paperbacks, so i knew i wouldn't like an 'e-paperback.'	1
	when the larger size was introduced, i got interested.	1
	some of the reviews of the dx make it sound like a mammoth device, but for anyone used to reading trade paperbacks and hardbacks, it is maybe a little taller but only half as wide.	1
	it is a little big to carry around every day, but portability was not an issue for me.	1
	i bought it to cut down on the number of books i bring into my house.	1
	when i got the dx, i was worried at first about the gray background.	1
	it seemed a little dark, but i quickly realized that it is much easier on my eyes.	1
	i usually read in bed and couldn't manage more than 15 minutes or so before my eyes tired out.	1
	now i am reading for an hour or more with no eyestrain at all.	1
	some reviews make it sound like the dx is better as an academic tool or pdf and publication reader than a book reader.	1
	i think it all depends on what you want the kindle to do.	1
	if you want it to replace the paperback in your backpack, the dx is not the device for you.	1
	if you're a home reader whose home is becoming overrun with books, it's a great alternative to more trades and hardbacks.       	1
	review of a new kindle owner.the dx is my first kindle, so i thought that i would share my first impressions with those wondering what it's like.	1
	size: too big to hold comfortably in one hand.	1
	this is more an issue of /size/ than weight (the center of gravity is so far from where you hold, that you have to cantilever it quite strongly).	1
	however, if i rest it on my forearm, with my hand wrapped around the opposite edge, it's actually quite comfortable (and, hey, my left hand reaches the next-page button *perfectly* that way).	1
	also comfortable: reading in bed (use hand to prop it up, but let the weight rest on your torso).	1
	sitting and reading: hold in 2 hands, resting on leg, couch arm, etc.	1
	as long as you don't try to support it with just one hand, you should be fine (note forearm solution above works just fine).	1
	the screen is about the same size as a hardback-book page, which i don't find too big at all.	1
	but, then, i enjoy robert jordan and other prolific authors.	1
	screen: really, really clear.	1
	need to sun-test it, when i have some sun (cloudy yesterday).	1
	graphics are great, as is the text.	1
	i can read the smallest size, but am happier with a slightly bigger font, so it's on size #2 right now.	1
	keyboard: i /like/ that it's small.	1
	hitting numbers is awkward, but the #1 purpose of this gizmo is reading.	1
	i write computer sw, and expect to use this as a mobile net-tablet from time to time, but i'll sacrifice a bigger keyboard for a slightly smaller device happily.	1
	one-side buttons: i did a little auto-rotation to test, and the higher position you hold you hand when the buttons are on the left is almost more comfortable than the right-hand position for me.	1
	i don't think that it will take long to get used to just the one-side buttons for old k2ers who have an open mind.	1
	kindle experience: matches what everyone's said about the k2/k1... so nothing to add here.	1
	my big complaints are the typical kindle thoughts: some way to organize content is /essential/, epub support, etc.      	1
	love it - only small improvement points.	1
	good, but still a few issues for technical users.the built in pdf reader is great, but if this is going to truly be a device for 'all of your personal and professional documents on the go' there is still a little bit of work needed.	1
	i see two issues - first, for business users, there is no file structure.	1
	so those 3500 documents?	1
	yeah, you have to scroll through them all to find the one you want.	1
	second, there is no note-taking ability in the pdf reader.	1
	you can still convert pdfs through 3rd party software to get this capability, but then you lose many formulas, formatting and pictures from the pdfs.	1
	if amazon can come up with a better conversion or a way to take notes in the pdf files, this is a win for technical users.      	1
	the kindle to get: dx.	1
	i quite like it..i purchased the original kindle (v1) a few months after it came out and was supremely underwhelmed.	1
	i ended up disliking the drm (i can't view the books on my computer?	1
	i can't print them?	1
	i can't sell them to someone else?)	1
	and so it became nothing but a glorified new york times reader.	1
	the screen was too small, the page turns too frequent (although they ceased being annoying after about an hour or two of use), and the lack of pdf made it of very limited use.	1
	for some reason, despite my recommendation to everyone not to buy a kindle, i nonetheless bought the kindle dx.	1
	i think i just wanted to give jeff bezos another try, despite his hypocritical (ok, pragmatic) attitude on drm.	1
	the kindle dx is great.	1
	i still won't buy any drm books from amazom, but here are the major pluses: * pdf works, very, very well.	1
	i only found one book so far which wouldn't render - a very pretty, multicolor organic chemistry textbook (original pdf, not scanned pdf).	1
	* the large screen is an absolute joy.	1
	it's like reading a hardback with small print, which is just what i like.	1
	and, when it's dark or i'm not wearing my glasses, i can up the type size to keep it readable in any situation.	1
	* newspapers are easier to read than the original kindle.	1
	and, since you are probably like me in that you toss the issues when you're done, not having to do that saves time and effort.	1
	it's also a lot easier to read on the subway.	1
	the kindle dx does have a few drawbacks from the kindle v1: * no expansion memory or swappable battery.	1
	clearly, following apple's (poor) lead here.	1
	* does not automatically save each issue of the new york times.	1
	i have to tell it to keep each issue individually, or it will auto-delete them.	1
	it's digital data; i plan to archive it permanently.	1
	(i paid for it, after all.)	1
	* newspapers are locked to a single kindle.	1
	you can't read the nyt on your iphone and the kindle, and if you lose the kindle you have, you can't read the files on another kindle.	1
	the bottom line is that the pdf support is the game changer.	1
	i have quite a few documents in pdf that are now a joy to read (including my own latex files).	1
	want to read about sotomayor from the crs?	1
	download the pdf to the kindle.	1
	too lazy to read wikileaks in preview (or reader, etc.)?	1
	read it on the kindle.	1
	the other complaints relate to price.	1
	amazon does not sell a 'print + kindle' book bundle for a reasonable price (say a buck or so above print price), although i think they should.	1
	i would buy everything that way if i had the choice.	1
	additionally, the kindle book prices are way too high.	1
	$7.99 for a print book, or $7.99 for a kindle book?	1
	really?	1
	even $9.99 (their 'bestseller hardcover' price) is too much for a book you are basically renting until amazon decides to cancel your account (which they have done, and causes you to lose access to all your books once your kindle breaks).	1
	and there is no way i'm going to pay more than that for a technical/physics/chemistry book (which are the majority of my purchases from a dollar perspective if not volume).	1
	still, if only for the pdf, larger screen and and new york times ($14/month kindle vs. about $30/mo print), i finally actually like the kindle and recommend the dx to anyone else who would avoid buying any kindle books from amazon.	1
	the device itself rates almost 5 stars (perhaps 4.5).	1
	the kindle book service rates 1 star (would be zero but you can't choose that).	1
	the kindle newspaper service rates about 3 stars (1 since you can't archive or transfer them, 5 because it's so convenient and reasonably priced).	1
	i wish the economist were offered on the kindle.      	1
	well worth the extra cost.as a committed kindle user, i wasn't sure that i needed the dx.	1
	but after having it for three days, i'm hooked.	1
	the larger screen is exactly what i needed to make kindle reading better, and it's much easier to read newspapers and cookbooks on the dx.	1
	i like it better for general reading, too.	1
	all in all, a great buy.       	1
	love my kindle.	1
	kindle dx 9.7 is the greatest.i received my kindle for christmas.	1
	i really wanted one, but was uneasy about spending the $$ without being able to look at one - other vendors of these types of devices allow previews.	1
	in any case, i did receive the kindle and absolutely love it.	1
	reading isn't like looking at a computer screen all day ... which is great.	1
	being able to enlarge the font size is wondeful ... the only minor drawback is the small keyboard .. but i guess i'd rather have more reading space, and it is usable.	1
	instantaneous download is great too.	1
	i haven't been able to see how it reads in the sunlight yet .. probably won't be able to until spring (gotta love that cleveland weather).	1
	i absolutely recommend this product ... i'll never give up normal books, but it's wonderful to have both!      	1
	kindle for the visual handcapped.	1
	moving from kindle 2 to kindle dx.	1
	carryingaround a complete library.	1
	best way to read in so many places.the kindle dx is fantastic!	1
	large clear screen, better reading surface than most books, supremely portable, 'lies flat,' keeps your place.	1
	fantastic for travel - no packing heavy books; also for reading in restaurants (unobtrusive), in bed, anywhere.	1
	access to additional books immediately.	1
	love the ability to change font size, move sideways, turn it over for lefthanders.	1
	pages turn almost instantaneously, not distracting at all.	1
	if you don't keep the wireless on, a charge seems to last forever.	1
	never have to figure out what to do with books after reading them.	1
	recognize it for what it is -- a portable reader.	1
	at that it is unsurpassed.	1
	it could be improved in many ways - cheaper books (but it's still cheaper than buying hard copies); ability to share with 1 or 2 friends as you would a hard copy; better organizing tools (folders!).	1
	if software permitted decent organization it could be a fantastic document organizer for lawyers, marketers, consultants, etc.	1
	those may come someday - for now it is better for its intended purpose than i ever believed possible.      	1
	newspaper first thing in the am.	1
	review of kindle dx and leather cover.	1
	it is wonderful.	1
	kindle dx review.	1
	dx from a former 2nd genner.	1
	kindle dx - nice overall.after trying the kindle app on my iphone (and to my surprise liking it), i decided to splurge a little and get the dx.	1
	after owning it for 2 1/2 days now, i think i've found a great reading device.	1
	my original goal was to try and consolidate a two foot stack of books into this one device.	1
	here are my initial opinions based on the features i've played with so far.	1
	- likes - i love the fact that it's so thin.	1
	when the cover is on it looks like any standard small organizer or notebook.	1
	it's small enough to carry with me anywhere i go.	1
	i really like the wireless capabilities of this little guy.	1
	i can search for and order reading material directly from the kindle, which is nice.	1
	i'm already spoiled by the iphone in that regard, so this is a continuation of that bliss.	1
	i've also tested sending documents to it via [...], and usb.	1
	they all work as advertised.	1
	i did notice that when sending an html page from the web, it didn't format very well.	1
	it basically looked like the programmer's source code.	1
	i sent a recipe with a picture though, it's probably designed to work with a basic page of text.	1
	the thing that sold me on the kindle is the ability to have it read to you.	1
	i love that feature!	1
	i have reference books and training materials that i need to read but can never seem to find the time.	1
	i was able to plop on my headphones at work and in the car and listen with relative ease.	1
	i found myself ignoring the 'fluff' and perking up when something important was being covered, kind of like i do while in a training class.	1
	the ability to carry my books and other documents, whether from email attachments or on my pc is very nice.	1
	the fact that you save an average of $[...] over the hardcopy makes spending the $[...] more palatable ($[...] plus shipping).	1
	i just need to buy about 50 books and i'd have paid for this device.	1
	the sleep screen is pretty cool.	1
	i expected the screen to be blank but instead it shows a full picture of various authors.	1
	i'm guessing that it has a nominal impact on the battery otherwise they would have just left it blank.	1
	interesting.	1
	- dislikes -no light??!!	1
	that seems like a no-brainer.	1
	i'm at a loss as to why this wasn't included.	1
	i'm not even asking for a backlight, which may or may not be technically possible (would be nice though).	1
	how about some pop-up leds to light up the screen similar to what's on some laptops today?	1
	an example of this is the hp 8530p.	1
	instead i have to resort to buying a goofy clip-on light that totally ruins the asthetics of the device, not to mention that it's an additional $[...], adds to the weight, and that i have to keep up with something else.	1
	this omission probably irks me the most.	1
	my wife, however, told me that she doesn't mind not having the light because it feels more like looking at a page then at a computer screen.	1
	i turned off the room light after she said that to make my point.	1
	she countered by flipping on her table lamp.	1
	i guess we agree to disagree.	1
	the other thing that bugs me is the lack of a way to better organize material on the kindle.	1
	sure, you can sort by title, author, or 'recently added', but i'd like the ability to put them in folders, or at least add additional custom fields and sort by those.	1
	for example, i want to separate my reference books from fictional books; or separate my wife's books from my own.	1
	i can tell already that as the number of books grows, the harder it's going to be to find material easily.	1
	a grouping system similar to what you find on the amazon book store would be nice.	1
	a couple of other nuicances i found were the latency issues when using the navigational buttons and the way the screen turns black when turning pages.	1
	the latency isn't bad, but it is noticable and sometimes makes you second guess yourself about whether you actually clicked the button or not.	1
	though i can't compare the weight to previous kindle versions (since i've never owned one), i can say that it could stand to lose a few ounces for a more comfortable one-handed reading experience.	1
	it isn't heavy by any means, but it isn't exactly light either.	1
	i guess it didn't help that i had it latched to the cover either.	1
	the voice that reads to you leaves much to be desired.	1
	after all these years of text-to-speech technology, i was hoping to hear a more natural voice.	1
	no such luck.	1
	it still sounds like a robot is reading to you, although a more refined robot than in the past.	1
	it sometimes errs on pronunciation or has bad grammar.	1
	for example, it flies through bullet points like they're part of the same sentence.	1
	but maybe that's because i'm forcing it to read a technical book to me.	1
	i'd probably do the same if i was reading it myself.	1
	in the end it's good enough to where i can understand without much effort.	1
	- other thoughts -i read that the battery lasts about 4-5 days on a single charge, 2 weeks if the wireless feature is turned off.	1
	i found out that if you fall asleep while the kindle is reading to you, it'll be completely dead when you wake up!	1
	next time i'll have it plugged in before going to bed.	1
	:-) in conclusion, we love the device for what it is.	1
	for me, it's great to have someone read to me since i always seem to be on the go.	1
	it's also great to have one device with most of my reading material.	1
	i find myself more encouraged to read since i have access to new books at any time and get instant gratification by being able to read it within a few minutes.	1
	i can easily see electronic books becoming the norm for publishing in the future.	1
	my wife and i are glad that we'll be ready.      	1
	dx, a fine large e-reader.i've used both a kindle 2 and a kindle dx.	1
	i love each of them.	1
	i dislike reading documents on a computer screen, and i have a large computer screen, but the kindle is a totally different experience.	1
	i am very comfortable reading the kindle, and have read a number of books on it.	1
	it is the size of a book; it has the feel of a light-weight book.	1
	i like the fact that i can travel light, not needing to lug around a pile of books.	1
	kindle 2 vs dx:  i prefer the kindle 2 to the kindle dx, because of its smaller size.	1
	it's easier to carry around, from room to room, or in a briefcase or pocketbook.	1
	the large size of the dx is the only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5.  however, if you will be using the largest font size (one can choose small print, large print, or several in between), then the dx would be preferred to the kindle 2, because of its larger page size.	1
	these are breakable, and need to be handled carefully.	1
	they will break if stepped on or dropped.	1
	a cover is a good idea.	1
	the expensive soft leather cover has a marvelous feel.	1
	the less expensive black amazon-logo cover works fine also; it has slightly easier access to the on-off switch and a tighter fit than the more expensive cover.      	1
	i love this thing!!	1
	!.	1
	outstanding product!!!!!	1
	!.i have been watching these devices since they first came out but resisted due to the small screen sizes.	1
	reading on my laptop is awkward and takes time to boot or restart each time.	1
	i travel quite a lot so i usually take a book or two along, so this larger size unit seemed ideal for me.	1
	i received it yesterday and and thus far i'm entirely satisfied with it.	1
	it starts quickly, is very legible, user friendly, the whisperjet downloads are very fast and easy to accomplish.	1
	i would like to see a brightness adjustment though as the screen needs some adjusting in differnt light situations.	1
	other than that though it is a very nice item!      	1
	great ereader... but not quite there yet.as a biology graduate student, i suppose i am part of amazon's target audience for the dx.	1
	this review is geared towards others in academia who are looking for a pdf ereader.	1
	i have never owned an ereader before; my main reason for buying this is to have easy reading access to my pdf library (1000+) which consists of journal articles, grants, books, etc.	1
	after playing around with the kindle, i find that for this purpose, it doesn't quite live up to my expectations.	1
	pros:-  the e-ink screen is gorgeous and definitely replicates a real ink-and-paper reading experience.	1
	also, navigation and page turns aren't as slow as i was expecting and are not particularly distracting.-  pdf rendering is great and very accurate, even for complicated documents with many pictures/tables/graphs.	1
	even previously annotated and modified pdfs (from my tablet pc) display correctly, with all my handwritten notes and highlights.	1
	it takes a few seconds to load (more for larger files), but page turns are fast.-  in portrait mode, normal letter size documents like journal articles look great and are very readable.	1
	the margin-cropping feature works well, and i haven't had major issues with the font size.-  the build quality is terrific.	1
	it's very thin and feels solid and well put together.	1
	the buttons and joystick controller are a little annoying (too stiff or not enough 'click') but otherwise, it's a good-looking and very functional reader.	1
	cons:-  no folders or other organization system!	1
	this is a huge flaw for me and may result in my returning the kindle if there isn't a firmware upgrade in the works.	1
	so my 1000+ pdf files can be copied in their normal folders to the main documents folder of the kindle with no problem (they stay organized on the kindle usb drive)... but then there is no organization of the files on the actual kindle display.	1
	it becomes one huge list of all the files, which you can sort by title, date added, or author (although author is very rarely included in the metadata).	1
	true, you can search the titles but this lack of folders is extremely inconvenient for when i need a particular paper but don't remember the specifics well enough to search for it.	1
	it's really ridiculous there isn't something as basic as folders on a gadget that amazon hopes to sell to academia.	1
	or even for non-academics, if amazon is touting the large internal storage for downloading and holding tons of books, then they really need to include an organization system for handling those books.	1
	-  the landscape display mode is not optimal for pdfs with 2-columns or large graphics.	1
	the accelerometer works well (maybe too sensitively), but the landscape mode just doesn't suit these types of pdfs.	1
	you can't scroll/pan, so the display just chops up the pages, oftentimes in the middle of a graphic.	1
	so you would need to flip the page back and forth in order to read columns or, for example, reference a legend/description for a large figure that was chopped into two pages.	1
	portrait mode is readable for me but i can imagine that small graph and figure text might be a problem for some and that trying to magnify via landscape mode would be highly annoying.-  there is absolutely no annotation/note-taking feature for pdfs.	1
	i had read another review somewhere which stated that notes can be added for whole pages, rather than within the text; this isn't true, and notes can't be added in any way.	1
	yes, the kindle can be a good pdf reader for students and professionals, but some sort of note-taking is also essential.	1
	for books and newspapers, the kindle does this beautifully and adds a txt file with your notes on its usb drive, which you can then easily access on your computer.	1
	even a really basic notes feature (e.g.	1
	one note per entire document) would be better than nothing.	1
	so the kindle dx may be worth it if you want a highly portable reader with great pdf rendering and battery life.	1
	it's definitely much better than trying to read pdfs on my iphone or netbook.	1
	besides academic stuff, i also read a huge amount of fiction so i will definitely get a lot of use out of it.	1
	however, it's still far from perfect, and i'm really hoping amazon is working on a firmware update that will resolve some of the issues i have with it.	1
	if you're just looking for a book reader, then stick w/ the more portable kindle 2.   so cmon amazon, if you really expect this to become popular with students/professionals, then fix these blaring issues!	1
	the hardware is great - fix the software (can it really be that hard to add folders??).	1
	**** edit:  sold the kindle and got a new sony prs-600 touch reader... and i couldn't be happier!	1
	it is so much better than the kindle in so many ways : native pdf support with zoom and panning, file organization capabilities, accurate page numbering and easy scrolling, sd card slot (hugely convenient), annotation/highlighting (including freehand with the stylus - even in pdfs), superb highly responsive touch interface (no more annoying joystick knob), overall faster loading/rendering than the kindle, and vastly superior design and form factor.	1
	and of course, $200 cheaper; you'll also save because you can check out drm-ed epub books from your library website.	1
	i don't miss the kindle-exclusive features at all (eg.	1
	wireless internet, 'read to me' synthetic voice).	1
	and i much prefer the smaller sleeker sony reader for better portability and handling.	1
	so if you're undecided about the kindle dx, go take a look at the sony prs 600 reader first!      	1
	early review: good but no pdf annotations.i've had this for a few hours.	1
	i held off on buying a kindle mainly because i mostly wanted one for reading and taking notes on pdfs, and when i saw this one it looked as though the time had come.	1
	reading pdfs works well -- very well, in fact.	1
	they're scaled down a bit, and the margins are intelligently cropped, so they're very readable.	1
	annotations and outlining, on the other hand, don't seem to exist for pdfs.	1
	i tried running a pdf through acrobat and making it accessible (a process that makes its text available to programs that know how to grab it), and no dice.	1
	i'm very much hoping that this will be a feature that's added in future software upgrades.	1
	this is a major sticking point for me, and one that i hadn't anticipated.	1
	one of the big selling points of the larger kindle is that it handles pdfs well; most pdf programs i've found at least allow standard notes to be added; and amazon advertises that annotations can be added to text.	1
	it just isn't obvious that this means 'text that isn't part of a pdf.'	1
	i'm guessing that academic users in particular who have been waiting for this product will be anticipating a capability that it doesn't have.	1
	if you can live without that feature or come up with a workaround, though, it's a very appealing product.      	1
	suggestions for academics.	1
	not for academic reading.i've been playing with the dindle dx for about a week now.	1
	overall like my device very much.	1
	love reading from it.	1
	however (at least for the one book i bought so far--queen of fashion), the note numbers are not links, and there is no way to read the endnotes while reading the text.	1
	the only way to do so, is to write down the chapter and note numbers and then go to the endnotes section, page through it until locating to the appropriate note.	1
	same goes for illustration (actually, i am not sure if the illustrations are included at all, have not been able to find them yet).	1
	also, page breaks are not indicated anywhere in the text, again diminishing the usefulness of reading for academic purposes (cannot cite to the page number).	1
	additionally, though index is included, the items in it are not linked to the text but rather display page numbers form the paper version of the book, and since those are unavailable in the kindle edition, this makes the index useless (and, no, searching the text does not substitute for the index) those shortcomings originate from the designers not taking academic readers into consideration when designing the device.	1
	hopefully, it is something that can be corrected in the next software update.	1
	until then, i will not buy any more books for research purposes.	1
	the pdf readers, on the other hand, has me much impressed.      	1
	amazing but simply pleasure!.received my dx on friday 6/12 and have barely put it down.	1
	at first i thought it was a little on the heavy side, then i picked up one of the books that i am replacing with the mobi version and the kindle is lighter.	1
	i also use it for pdfs and so far it has worked flawlessly.	1
	in the first 36 hours i read 200 pages of a 400 page technical book.	1
	it is very easy on the eyes and i am no where near as tired as when i used my laptop to try to read this same document.	1
	only drawback is that for almost 500 bucks it should include some sort of case because it scratches very easily.	1
	a metal clip-on night light left several faint scratches.	1
	all in all i love it and would highly recommend it.      	1
	new kindle owner.the dx is the first kindle i have ever owned, and i am very pleased with it.	1
	the downloads are fast and easy, and the e-ink display is absolutely phenomenal.	1
	i can't stop staring at it and marveling at how it looks so much like real paper.	1
	i was a little nervous waiting for it to arrive, because some people have written that it is rather large for reading in bed, and is much heavier than the other kindles.	1
	but i think it's delightfully lightweight and portable, and i found that it was pretty easy for reading in bed as well.	1
	overall, i am very very pleased.	1
	i can't wait until they make color kindles, although i know that the technology is still a year or two away.	1
	this is definitely going to college with me in place of textbooks!      	1
	ebook: not yet ready for prime time.	1
	but help is coming!.	1
	upgraded from the kindle 2.i'll start by saying i'm not a business professional, and that i do not use my dx primarily as a pdf viewer.	1
	i'm a college student (majoring in english literature) and i use my dx for researching and casual reading.	1
	this is what i base my review on.	1
	if you're interested in how well the dx performs for professionals, or as a textbook replacement, i really can't give much advice.	1
	with that said, i've replaced my kindle 2 with the dx and am very happy with that decision.	1
	i've owned the dx just over 30 days now and have decided to keep it and sell my kindle 2.  i'll try to keep my review fairly short and to the point, so i'll just be comparing the dx to the k2, and let you know why i prefer the dx.	1
	the size of the screen is the most obvious enhancement with the dx, and it really doesn't disappoint.	1
	the screen is nearly the size of the entire k2, which gives the dx many advantages, some of which i've not seen mentioned in other reviews.	1
	this increase in size makes reading quicker, and most importantly, recreates the experience of reading a hardcover book, without the many disadvantages of hardcover.	1
	with the dx, there are more words, both horizontally and vertically.	1
	this is great not only for increasing reading speed, but also immersion.	1
	i much prefer being able to see entire paragraphs on each page, rather than typically one, and part of another, like with the k2.	1
	in order to achieve this with my k2, i had to lower the font size more than i wanted.	1
	and this is needed if you're reading poetry.	1
	line count is just as important to many poems as the words themselves, so it's necessary to retain the original form of the poem.	1
	it's also nice when reading plays, or stories with a lot of dialogue.	1
	the words are less crowded, so it's easier to differentiate between dialogue between two or more characters.	1
	the larger screen is a great improvement for other things as well, such as books with pictures and graphics, newspapers, magazines, viewing the cover of the book, and so forth.	1
	one common complaint or concern is the weight and size of the dx.	1
	in my experience, the weight and size is fine.	1
	it's roughly the size of a hardcover book, but not nearly as thick, and still lighter than the typical hardback i compared it to.	1
	i always found the thickness of hardbacks to be the most frustrating, and not necessarily the weight.	1
	when carrying the dx, it's comparable to holding a small notebook to your side.	1
	the only time the weight is somewhat uncomfortable is when i have my leather cover on my dx.	1
	what i typically do, if i'm going to be reading for a long period of time, is take my dx out of its cover, then put it back in when i'm finished.	1
	the dx by itself is very comfortable.	1
	my arms or wrists never get overly tired.	1
	and i actually prefer the more weighty, solid feel.	1
	i mentioned earlier that i use the dx to aid in research i've been doing over various literature over the summer, and it's made my life much easier.	1
	for my research, i mostly read novels and look for patterns and themes, then take out passages that support my findings.	1
	instead of writing or typing out these passages, i can quickly highlight and save, then hook the dx to my computer via usb, and all my notes are ready to be printed out.	1
	it's really simple.	1
	the only problem is these ebooks lack page numbers.	1
	mla does not have any way of citing from the kindle yet, so i still have to look at a physical copy of the book to properly cite, but it's still very handy.	1
	i also want to address not having a next page button the left side of the dx.	1
	at first i thought this would bother me, but i've found i prefer it, but only on the dx.	1
	this is because i can hold the dx with my left hand and not worry about my thumb applying too much pressure and turning the page.	1
	i'm right handed, though.	1
	i find the dx makes reading even more enjoyable than the k2 in nearly every way.	1
	the k2 certainly has a more cute appearance, and falls more in line with the standards of today with making electronics smaller when possible, but the dx is better as far as usefulness.        	1
	i know these things will get a lot better, fellow early adopters.i like my kindle dx.	1
	it's my first kindle and first e-reader so i can't compare it to anything else.	1
	but it definitely has an 'early-generation' feel about it.	1
	something like that 1.3 megapixel olympus camera i bought for $800 back in the day.	1
	you know--you just know--that rapid development will occur on these and the current generation will feel archaic in the matter of a few years.	1
	having said all of that, i think they did a pretty good job.	1
	i give it four stars.	1
	i might even give it five, but for a couple of niggles: 1) the five-way controller is horrendous.	1
	impossibly tiny and not terribly reassuring in perceived durability.	1
	i would have much preferred a five-way control similar to those on cell phones, being able to click four ways (or perhaps like the 'd-pad' on a game controller) with a button in the middle to click.	1
	it would have been easier and more durable 2) i wish the background were more 'white.'	1
	it's too grey for my tastes.	1
	that's probably just a current limitation of the e-paper/ink technology, but it is what it is.	1
	i like reading the paper on the dx and am reading my first novel.	1
	i've finally gotten to the point where i'm not thinking about the technology and only about the story--and i guess that's where this thing succeeds.	1
	thumbs up, amazon.	1
	though i'm pretty sure i'll feel stupid for spending 500 dollars on this thing a few years from now.      	1
	kindle dx as pdf reader.i have only had the kindle for a couple days, and overall i like it.	1
	but one of the primary reasons i wanted it was to view pdfs.	1
	being in an academic environment, i have access to a large number of books and dissertations in pdf format, i wanted to be able to use the kindle to read them rather than print them out.	1
	many of the problems/issues with the kindle as a pdf reader have already been discussed such as not being able to use the text-to-speech feature, increase the font size (other than by rotating it), etc.	1
	one thing i haven't seen addressed yet is that the kindle does not read files that have been compressed by adobe acrobat.	1
	i have been scanning old documents and dissertations, running them through ocr, and then often compressing them since the files can be very large (eg.	1
	70 mb).	1
	when i first loaded some pdfs on my kindle, i found i could read some, but not others.	1
	at first i thought it was because the file sizes of the ones i couldn't read were too large.	1
	but after some testing, it appears it had nothing to do with file size.	1
	it turned out i was not able to read files that i had compressed.	1
	i now need to re-think my practice of compressing pdf files.	1
	i think this is also addressed in the documentation, but it would really be nice if one could use the basic web browser on the kindle to download pdfs direct.	1
	right now you can't, so you have to download them onto your computer and then transfer them over.	1
	bummer. 	1
	perfect iteration of the 'ipod for books'.	1
	the best version yet!.as someone who has owned all three versions of the kindle since their introductions i have to say that this is my favorite by far.	1
	the screen is just perfect in terms of size as you're not constantly flipping pages and pdfs renders perfectly.	1
	the kindle 2 by comparison is just a bit too small for everyday reading.	1
	it's good for traveling i suppose.	1
	the speed of the dx is also much faster.	1
	i guess they put in a more powerful processor.	1
	pages refresh faster and navigations are also faster.	1
	for some reason the screen looks better than the kindle 2, almost as if it had more gray shades (it's the same as the kindle 2).	1
	the only negative i see is that the weight is getting to be a bit much.	1
	i would have liked it at about half the weight.	1
	if you read a lot it can be tiresome to hold it for extended periods.	1
	if you add the leather cover, it really puts in over the edge.	1
	i thought that the point of having an e-book was because of the weight savings?	1
	if it starts to approach that of a real book it sort of defeats the purpose (i know.	1
	not if you compare it against having multiple books).	1
	hopefully, in the next version they will make it lighter and perhaps include folders like many have requested since kindle 1.      	1
	the sync function saves me.i've had the kindle dx for two days now and i have mixed feelings about it.	1
	i also have a kindle 2 and i'm comparing the two.	1
	the dx is so big, which is both good and bad.	1
	i can read a lot more per page, which is good, but it won't fit into my purse, which is bad.	1
	figures (from 'on food and cooking' by harold mcgee) are much larger and sharper on the dx than on the 2.  i have a paper copy, too, and i compared the dx with it and found them to be equally clear and sharp.	1
	i think i expected the dx to replace the 2, but instead it's going to complement it.	1
	i'll use the dx at home and the 2 when i go elsewhere.	1
	the dx is too big to carry around, since i can't just tuck it in my purse as i do with the 2.  the thing that saves me is the sync function.	1
	incidentally, the same usb/power cord works on both the dx and the 2.  i'd bought an extra for the 2, as well as a car charger, and i'm very pleased that these work for the dx as well.	1
	the native pdf function is wonderful.	1
	nasa puts out all its technical papers in pdf so i can read them on the dx.	1
	this is helpful as i'm in the process of updating a paper i wrote in the early '90s to be part of a history series.	1
	using the dx saves switching from window to window as i write.	1
	the figures and photos are easy to read, too.	1
	i miss the page controls on the left side, as i like to hold my reading material in my left hand.	1
	however, i can turn the dx upside down, with the display following the rotation, and that puts the page controls under my left thumb, where i like them.	1
	i really wish that amazon would come out with some way to organize books, such as folders.	1
	i've got over three hundred titles and it can be a real struggle to find what i'm looking for.	1
	there's a surprising amount of variation in how author names are formatted, so that's not a fool-proof way of finding things.	1
	if i had to choose between the dx and the 2 i'd have a really hard time.	1
	for just plain text, particularly away from home, the kindle 2 wins.	1
	for figures and pdfs, particularly at home, the kindle dx wins.	1
	i'm just glad i've got both of them and don't have to pick one.   	1
	i like it, but could be improved..	1
	i'm in love....	1
	pdf support good start, needs vast improvements to be usable!!	1
	!.upgraded from kindle2 to kindledx mainly for native pdf support, for engineering documents (e.g.	1
	ieee papers etc) pdf reader is a good start but needs a lot of improvements to be usable.	1
	here is my basic wish list for pdf reader built into kindledx:1. support reflow - today, multicolumn documents are a pain to read on kindledx2.	1
	support zoom - for e.g.	1
	fit width, fit visible, zoom in, zoom out ...3. support for links i have tried almost all ebook readers available, and this is by far the best!	1
	hope amazon will add these features through a firmware update, making a good device, great.      	1
	life changing gift!.	1
	my first kindle.i just received my kindle dx and i am in love.	1
	i read a lot of the reviews that had negative things to say about this product but i just don't see it as anything but wonderful.	1
	i love to read and the dx's ability to hold 3500 books is a real wow for me.	1
	i also have been wanting to go back and reread some of the old science fiction authors i loved as a kid.	1
	the ability to buy the complete works of the older authors for a dollar or less is great.	1
	i also don't have to look all over the place to find them and they don't take up any physical space in my home.	1
	i may find some negative things to say later on but for now, i am very happy with my new tool.	1
	my only complaint for now is the price.	1
	ouch. 	1
	a vast improvement.i first bought the original kindle dx with national wireless.	1
	it was pretty awful, but i did not realize that it was the fault of the network (sprint).	1
	i live in los angeles, and i never saw more than 3 bars on the connection (most of the time i was unable to connect, or had one or two bars).	1
	now, i have all five, instantly.	1
	it works as fast as it should.	1
	i love it.	1
	the larger screen is worth it because it come with much more capacity.	1
	i want to use it for textbooks as well.	1
	even still, i am reading for pleasure more than i have in my entire life.	1
	i am extremely happy with this device.	1
	my husband has the kindle 2, but i am much more comfortable with the larger display, even for leisure reading purposes.	1
	no matter which you choose, the kindle is probably the future of reading.      	1
	kindle dx.	1
	technology wonder.i bought this for my wife at xmas.	1
	she had broken her writst and is an avid reader but couldn't hold a book in her one hand.	1
	the kindle did the trick and she loves it more than any other present she has received.	1
	she became proficient in its use almost immediately which shows how easy it really is.	1
	keep up the good work.      	1
	kindle dx.	1
	kindledx - go big, or go home.	1
	really nice but a couple of things you should know.	1
	a paradigm changer!.	1
	a booklover's fantasy tech.	1
	my husband is the best ever... wow!	1
	a kindle!	1
	!.my husband, superhero in all ways in my book, just went totally over the top this christmas and bought me the kindle dx.	1
	i was so surprised, and so touched.	1
	the kindle has been on my wish list forever, and i recently changed the wish to the new one... but he knows me so well he didn't even need to look at the wish list.	1
	he just made it happen.	1
	wow.	1
	i figured it would just be out there in 'someday' wish-land.	1
	now here it is.	1
	it is gorgeous, highly readable, easy to set up and use, and with the leather cover that he also provided, i feel confident that the kindle will stay in great shape!	1
	i'm a huge reader, with a house overrun by books and several magazine subscription, so the kindle is a huge advantage in terms of clutter reduction!	1
	of course i will still buy special books for my library, but most books just aren't special enough to add to an already large collection.	1
	the point is to read them, and that's where the kindle dx comes in.	1
	i am also always on the go and very tired of lugging books with me (after all, we really can't leave home without them, can we?).	1
	this device will save me from hefting books around.	1
	the fact that it is also pdf compatible is amazing and wonderful, as many things i read are in that format... but then one either has to be at the computer or print reams of documents to read them.	1
	that is solved with the kindle as well.	1
	the kindle dx is the biggest, best, most fabulous reading device on the market.	1
	again, all i can say is wow!!	1
	i love that you can download samples of books under consideration, and the included kindle guide is wonderful and easy to understand.	1
	a sure winner... now i can lug around tons of books and not strain so much as my little finger.	1
	fabulous device, and i am one lucky woman!       	1
	amazing product that changes how much your read.i purchased dx since i have a long commute and like to read computer books on the train.	1
	it works perfectly for that.	1
	almost all computer books in pdf format render well but a few require minor editing in acrobat to reduce margins (so main text would become bigger).	1
	there are plenty of free fiction books in mobi format which paginate better than pdfs.	1
	i do not use protective case but put the unit into a laptop case while carrying.	1
	a few times software hung so i had to find a way to reboot it (holding power switch for 15 seconds) and once in a while pdf rendering reboots the kindle.	1
	battery life for me is around 2 weeks with disabled radio and auto-pivot.	1
	reading new york times on kindle was somewhat disappointing.	1
	it required to open every article within a section, instead of showing headlines and deciding which ones to read.	1
	enabling wireless drains batter really fast.	1
	i am sure it all depends on the strength of sprint signal.	1
	the weaker the signal, the more power cell transmitter uses.	1
	speed of pagination is acceptable for sequential reading but is rather annoying while looking for something.	1
	the best 'feature' for me is that my eyes do not get tired while reading kindle.	1
	overall it is an amazing device and small flaws do not damage value it brings.	1
	i was debating if the rating should be 4 star or 5 but eventually decided that for me it is much closer to 5 than to 4.      	1
	kindle dx wireless.	1
	my kindle dx.	1
	very pleased customer..	1
	best birthday present!.	1
	the good, the bad and the ugly.	1
	even better than kindle 2 !!!!!	1
	!.	1
	kendle dx- travelrs dream.the kindle dx is an outstanding product.	1
	its large screen makes reading a pleasure especially newspapers.	1
	reading books is great also, because of its large screen size.	1
	on a recent plane trip, there was considerable turblance so i increased the print size to avoid motion sickness that i get under these conditions.	1
	i also own a sony reader.	1
	their books require a computer to download to the reader and they are a pain to load.	1
	my reader will not work with my new vista 64 bit notebook.	1
	the cost of the sony books is always quite a bit more costly.	1
	the almost instant downloading of books on the kendle from anywhere, is a great advantage.	1
	the fact that there is no cost for downloading the books is an added benifit.	1
	it is only one click to load a book.	1
	the ability to purchase newspapers is great when traveling.	1
	on a cruise or long land trip, it is great to take all the books you need in one small package.	1
	j. o'rourke	1
	far exceeds my expectations!!!	1
	!.i have been looking and waiting for quite a long time for a product like the kindle dx.	1
	after coming up empty for so long, i was actually considering purchasing a notepad pc, just to be able to read e-books more easily wherever i wanted to, not being limited to my desktop, or having to lug around my laptop.	1
	i had considered also the earlier versions of the kindle, but due to their small screen size, i just couldn't justify it - and i know i wouldn't be content with it.	1
	i have to say, the wait has rewarded me tremendously!	1
	the kindle dx has far far exceeded my expectations.	1
	i can't remember the last time i was so excited about purchasing a product.	1
	it is everything it is advertised to be - every pdf file that i have loaded into it has come up perfectly.	1
	it automatically bookmarks when i stop reading at a certain point and auto-shuts off.	1
	with its 9.7' screen, it reads just like a real book.	1
	i checked out a few of the newspapers, and just as it advertises, they were on my kindle dx first thing in the morning.	1
	although the content was not the same as getting the actual paper (at least in the ones that i tried), for instance seeing the standings for ml baseball, or a chart or graph, the articles were all present.	1
	i'm sure with time the other content will follow since the dx has the capability.	1
	the two drawbacks, if you can call them that, are more of a personal thing with me - one is the prices of the newspapers in my opinion are too high for what they are.	1
	in fact, i think that they are close to what you would pay for a full paper edition on most of them.	1
	i hope that the prices will come down in time too.	1
	the other factor, which i'm sure a lot of people will agree, is that when you put documents on the kindle, you can create sub-folders on the kindle when it is connected to your pc and put different documents into the different sub-folders, but when you look at your document list on the kindle after disconnecting, (the home screen as it is called) they have no rhyme or reason - they are just there in one big list.	1
	i only have about 150 or so e-books on my kindle right now, i can't imagine if someone had 500 or more!	1
	i have said something to amazon about that, and they appreciated my input and said that either in future updates or new versions of the kindle, that may be possible.	1
	for now, i accept it for what it is and continue to enjoy my kindle everywhere i go!      	1
	great product.does what i want.	1
	the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was that i wish it had just a little stronger browser capabilities.	1
	if you are getting this to be a internet browser, you will be disappointed.	1
	if you are getting it solely to read books, and the limited browser is just an extra, you will be happy with this product.      	1
	will need page numbers for use in educational context.i recently purchased a kindle dx and was horrified to learn that there is no way for me to find the page number of a book that i am reading.	1
	the modern language association does not provide guidelines for citation by kindle 'location,' and the lack of any way to get real page numbers in kindle texts will be a serious problem for academics who want to use the kindle dx for research purposes and in the classroom.	1
	'please turn to page .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	uh .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	i mean location 561 if your screen and text size are the same as mine?'	1
	i had been considering teaching a course with a kindle option for 2010, and will put that on hold until this problem is addressed in future kindles - and fixed in the one i already bought!	1
	stable, reliable page numbers allow for reliable citation, promote academic honesty, and facilitate scholarly conversation.	1
	kindle is shooting itself in the foot by not providing them.	1
	kindle will also need a function for annotating and hilighting pdfs, a better keyboard, a way or organizing digital library and notes, and scholarly publications at reasonable prices (seriously, $100+ for a file?	1
	why did you bother?)	1
	other than that, i have to say the kindle dx is pretty awesome, esp.	1
	for those of you looking at older texts available free in the public domain.      	1
	reading books yes, managing technical docs no.echoing what others have said.	1
	this beauty is wonderful for reading books.	1
	absolutely love it for this purpose.	1
	but i jumped into this because i have several hundred research articles in pdf format i wanted to carry around with me.	1
	it seemed like the dx would fit the bill, letting me have my library anywhere i wanted without needing to boot up the laptop.	1
	should have done a little more homework - what genius thought this would serve academics/professionals without the ability *at a minimum* to organize documents into folders?	1
	i don't want my books, newspapers, etc.	1
	mixed up with 500 other articles.	1
	my pdf library is sorted by folders according to publication year, and i'd like to keep that on the kindle as that's how i navigate it.	1
	i suppose i could figure out some way to tag the pdfs, but that's more work.	1
	this may sound like a minor point, but this is a real usability issue for what i (and i suspect many other people who amazon has targeted with the dx) do.	1
	i'm going to give this a few more days, but i will likely return this and go for the plain kindle 2.  giving it three stars for being over-hyped for academics and professionals.	1
	it's not just about the viewing and reading experience.      	1
	perfection personified.to be succinct: wow!	1
	like many, i was skeptical--and to a large degree--of just how much i would like the dx.	1
	i had owned the k1, then bought the k2 in march, and was quite content to take comfort and succor in my k2.	1
	then all of the hyperbole about the dx is announced--and my wife turned to me and saliently uttered these words: 'it looks like you will be spending $500.	1
	there goes our dinner at roy's!'	1
	bottom line: i'm out the $500, we still went to roy's, and this dx is truly the apotheosis of what a kindle should be.	1
	love the screen, the crispness of the text,  and ability to switch to a landscape mode.	1
	all i can say is this: it was worth every penny to switch from the k2.	1
	this is exactly what i would have wanted all along!	1
	to all of the new dx owners: isn't it great?!	1
	as for the folks who own a k2--as i did and still do--you will want to upgrade to dx when the time is right.	1
	amazon hit a home run with this thing.	1
	bravo!      	1
	definitely a great investment!	1
	exactly what i hoped it would be!.i just received my dx late yesterday evening and i am totally hooked already.	1
	this is my first kindle, so i can't compare it to the smaller kindle 1 or 2. i wanted a bigger screen since i prefer hardback books or the larger paperbacks as opposed to the small/standard paperbacks.	1
	i am fairly young (33) and i like reading my kindle dx at the 4th largest font size or even the 5th if i am reading it from somewhat of a distance.	1
	i like not having to press the next page button as often as i have heard that some users do on the kindle 2.  the weight doesn't bother me since i am used to carrying my laptop around the house reading the kindle forum discussions and/or hardback books.	1
	also, i can always rest it on my leg or the arm of the chair if i get tired of holding it.	1
	i would like to say that i am one of the dx's biggest fans!	1
	i did a lot of research before ordering it.	1
	the e-ink is easy to read.	1
	no complaints from me!      	1
	great outdoor reading.i received my kindle dx today.	1
	it was supposed to be backordered for five weeks but i got it in two.	1
	my office manager has a kindle 1 and she told me that in our rural area it was necessary to download books to the computer and then connect the kindle and transfer it using the usb cable.	1
	i bought my first book and before i could connect the cable it was wirelessly downloading my book.	1
	apparently the kindle dx will work even with ancient cell phone technology.	1
	it took about three minutes to download a book.	1
	i went outside to read after dinner and noticed several things;  you don't have to use two hands to keep the wind from blowing the pages so swatting flies and petting the dog are easily accomplished while reading.	1
	as dusk developed, reading was very easy.	1
	i am an ophthalmologist and i tried the large print on the large dx screen and it is a lot better than large print books.	1
	i will be recommending this to my macular degeneration patients before talking books.	1
	i really think this thing deserves a seven star rating.      	1
	good, however.i have been using dx for about two weeks now.	1
	it is good as promoted by amazon.	1
	i am a graduate student, and is comfortable to get rid of the tons of textbooks, need no longer to print out technical papers.	1
	the longevity of the battery also saves a lot trouble.however, there are something that i can't stop thinking.	1
	the pricing scheme for e-text books sucks.	1
	generally they are only around 30% off the 'printed' price, considering the facts that we can not resell them  and there is no accompanying cds which is supposed to be part of the books.	1
	i can buy second-handed, even new book at a much lower rate.what is more, some of the images in the dx are blurred,and occasionally, tables/forms go out of range.	1
	finally i can keep my books for, say, at least ten years.	1
	how about this device?      	1
	awesome.... completely awesome.i have never had a kindle before the kindle dx and i am in love with the dx.	1
	i e-mail lists to myself all the time to keep on my kindle.	1
	i downloaded a sample of a biology textbook to see what the images would look like and they look pretty good.	1
	i hope that this kindle dx replaces all of my textbooks for the rest of my college career.	1
	i have read 5 books on it since i got it.	1
	the only bad thing is that i am spending too much money on books-lol.	1
	it is the perfect size for me.       	1
	the godzilla of kindles tries to conquer the ereader world.i've been a very happy 1st-generation kindle (referred to henceforth in this review as the k1), since last april, and as a disabled person who's always loved to read but for various reasons (including the physical difficulties in handling an actual book), the device reintroduced the reading experienced and substantially changed my world.	1
	when the 2nd-generation kindle (referred to henceforth as the k2) came on the scene, i didn't feel overly compelled to upgrade to the new version because there was not a significant advantage, in my view, to do so.	1
	but when the kindle dx was announced with it's larger screen and specifically the native pdf support, which as one who had converted many software manual pdfs for reading on the k1 with passable but not great results, i couldn't resist taking the plunge and upgrading.	1
	i've now been using the kindle dx (referred to henceforth as the kdx), since thursday (this review is being typed on sunday), so here is my first impressions review.	1
	the first thing i noticed about the kdx is that it could as easily be called the kindle jumbo, or the kindlenormous, because compared to my k1 (as stated above, i never owned a k2) it's huge!	1
	i've seen several people comment on the difference in size, and one might get the impression from various comments (including my own above) that the device requires a forklift to pick up and a warehouse to house.	1
	the truth is that the kdx is only big in relation to the prior kindles.	1
	in fact, if this had been the size of the first kindle, i think everyone would have felt it was the perfect size.	1
	as for the increased weight over its smaller brethren, if i personally had to manually hold it, for me with my disability, it would be a real problem.	1
	it's not really the weight itself, but due to the center of gravity being more spread out as opposed to the more compact k1 and k2.	1
	basically, if you hold the device vertically near the bottom, it becomes top heavy.	1
	because of this, i don't know if i'd consider the kdx the best choice for the casual reader, especially one who hasn't owned a kindle before.	1
	sort of like buying a full-sized hummer for the little old lady from pasadena who just wants to run to the grocery store twice a week.	1
	doesn't mean a hummer isn't great in itself, but it would be just a bit of overkill for the proverbial old lady's needs.	1
	as for the kdx itself (and keep in mind that i've never owned or touched a k2, so some of the things that impressed me might be applicable to the k2 as well), it is truly amazing.	1
	my own feeling is that this design greatly improves upon what was begun with the k1.	1
	in fact i'd go so far as to say that the k1 seems more like a production or beta model...a great beta model, but a beta model nonetheless.	1
	the kdx feels more sturdy (and i think this due more to the case construction than the overall weight), and as i said, more polished than the k1.	1
	i like the 5-way controller (introduced with the k2) much more than the k1's scroll wheel.	1
	while i used the scroll wheel without any qualms whatsoever, it always felt a bit kludgy, as if it was a bit 'low tech-ish' for such an advanced product.	1
	the k1 display is great, and if images are done well, they can be quite beautiful.	1
	however, if images are done right for the kdx, they are mind blowing in comparison.	1
	the k1 always has looked great to me considering it's limited abilities, but the kdx shows just what eink technology is capable of.	1
	seeing this screen now has me excited for the first time about the prospect of a color eink screen one day, because if they can do this with 16-shade grayscale now, imagine what we're in store for in a few years.	1
	i checked how a couple of my own books' covers looked on the kdx, and they looked great even at the larger size.	1
	the kdx screen is also more elongated than it's little brothers', so you get more text per screen not just because of the larger size, but because of proportionally having more screen real estate to work with.	1
	text is sharp and the interface differences from the k1 are also pleasurably improved.	1
	again, i would use the expression 'more polished' to describe the difference.	1
	some of that is due to the improved screen resolution, i'm sure.	1
	the kdx's responsiveness is better overall, although that's a relative thing since a large pdf or a page laden with images will take longer to display than a plain text page, regardless of which kindle you own.	1
	i do notice that when one scrolls the cursor with the 5-way controller, that it flies down the page.	1
	not sure if the k1 could have done that it if had used the same controller, so i think the screen refresh rate is improved on the kdx (again, this may be true for the k2 as well).	1
	i don't subscribe to any newspapers currently, but blogs look great on the kdx.	1
	on my k1, if you viewed the article list in a blog, you'd get a simple list of article titles.	1
	on the kdx, you get titles, a summary or first line from the article, and divider lines separating each listed article.	1
	not to sound repetitive (although clearly i am guilty of just that), but 'more polished is again the way i'd describe this difference.	1
	i also own several kindle books that are now listed as 'dx optimized' (most of them being software reference books).	1
	these books look as if their layouts are very close to, if not identical to, their printed counterparts.	1
	one thing i've noticed, and i'll use one of the books i own, , as an example.	1
	my guess is that the images contained in the book are in color in the printed book, and were directly scanned into ebook format 'as is.'	1
	this becomes problematic because of the grayscale display, which shows these images as various shades of gray, often with little contrast between the different shades.	1
	the biggest problem, however, is that the gray in the images do not contrast well to the gray background of the screen.	1
	the gray screen provides plenty of contrast for text on the kdx, but for images with a lot of gray shades in them, the lack of contrast makes the images look washed out.	1
	i would therefore strongly urge amazon to take the 'dx optimized' designation even further and make sure that the images in these books are also optimized for the grayscale display, because they do the kdx fabulous display capabilities justice.	1
	the pdfs i have loaded onto my kdx look wonderful as well.	1
	most of my pdfs are adobe software manual, and therefore they are true pdfs (not all pdfs are the same, or true pdfs) with lots of imagery, and they seem to display almost flawlessly in their native format.	1
	so the it appears that the promise and the biggest reason i once again invested a significant amount of money with amazon has proven to be well worth it.	1
	a personal note about the kindle dx's size.	1
	the kdx is too big for my kindle stand from octo, so i have to prop up against other stuff on my bed, which is fine, and actually works well for this godzilla of kindles.	1
	however, when i want to charge the kdx while i read (which i generally do nightly), i have to turn it upside down because the charging plug is on the bottom of the device, and so can't be 'stood up' on that end while charging.	1
	so for me, the screen flipping technology is a godsend, although oddly enough, neither the screen savers nor the kindle store will flip.	1
	probably because neither could display properly in horizontal mode.	1
	still, it's annoying to be using the kindle in one orientation but then be forced to reorient the device if i want to dash off to the kindle store briefly.	1
	while certainly a minor thing, i'd really like to see amazon enable the screen flipping technology to work with the kindle store as well.	1
	overall, i already love my dx.	1
	while i'll always love my k1 as well, i just don't have the need for both, so i'm glad the k1 will have a happy new home with my sister.	1
	the kdx is an excellent addition to the kindle family, while it was promoted as a device targeted to students and others with specific large-format document needs, the kdx could have easily been the first kindle released, and i believe that it would have been equally successful even at the larger size.	1
	if you're thinking of buying a kindle dx, or are especially debating between a k2 or kdx, i'd recommend you really assess your needs and uses for your kindle, and use those to help make your decision.	1
	the kdx itself is amazing and expands on the promise and functionality of the original kindles.	1
	but some may buy the kdx and then criticize it, not because of the device's failings (of which i have seen none yet), but because they perhaps would have been better served by a smaller kindle instead.	1
	so while i say any potential kindle buyer should choose wisely depending upon their needs, the kindle dx is in itself an outstanding product that will only help to solidify the kindle brand as the standard by which all other ereaders will be compared.	1
	where i gave the 1st-generation kindle 5 stars, based upon how the kindle dx has improved upon the design and functionality, i'd give the kdx 10 stars if i could.      	1
	had to return it for a broken feature....i had my dx for about three days, and it is a great device.	1
	i bought it originally for its pdf capability.	1
	though i couldn't highlight or take notes with the pdf reader, i was ok with it.	1
	however, for some reason the browser wouldn't work for my dx.	1
	the wireless connection was on the whole time.	1
	i could buy books with it no problem, but just couldn't use the browser.	1
	an error message would show up under the url bar, and the rest of the screen would be blank.	1
	i even called the kindle support, but they still couldn't solve my problem.	1
	and one thing the guy told me was a bit disappointing.	1
	since the web browser function is just 'experimental', they don't have standard troubleshooting for it.	1
	i guess it's the problem of my own device, or the fact that i live in hawaii?	1
	since i couldn't get an exchange for a seemingly malfunctioning device, i could only return it.	1
	even though it's still a great e-reader in many ways, i think i would pass up this time.	1
	spending nearly $500 for a device that does not perform all its advertised functions is just not acceptable.	1
	-----------------also, i remember that a pdf file i copied onto the dx using usb could not get any of the figures displayed.	1
	i then sent it through the kindle e-mail and the pictures showed up, but with less quality.	1
	and for the 'conversion', i paid 15 cents.	1
	however, it's still only a pdf, and you still cannot hightlight or take notes.	1
	so if you use the e-mail function to send any pdf file, then you will be charged the 15 cents 'conversion' fee (maybe it's just the transmission fee), whether the file has figure or not.	1
	so this creates a problem.	1
	say if you have a file with greater than 10mb file size and many figures on it, then you are out of luck to see the figures on the dx.	1
	because you probably won't be able to send it via e-mail, and you won't be able to see the figures when simply transferring that file to the dx using the usb.	1
	this is a potential problem that people should watch out.      	1
	met all my expectations.as an early owner of the sony book reader, i watched my family being in love with their kindle and later with kindle 2. we had many lively arguments about the pros and cons of the two.	1
	i liked the open standards nature of the sony reader with its ability to display pdf, doc, and jpg content, so that i could take my work documents on my travel along with my favorite books.	1
	as soon as it was announced, i asked my family to get me a kindle dx as a father's day present, since it addresses all my needs with its high resolution that is best suitable for reading the pdf material, while sharing the book libraries with my family.so far, my kindle dx has met all my expectations and then some.	1
	the high resolution screen is awesome, while the device is incredibly thin and relatively light.	1
	yes, there is a laundry list of the nice-to-have features that i would like to have, such as grouping of my content in folders, which sony reader does better.	1
	however, a great product today is better than a perfect product in some distant future...       	1
	this is the best kindle yet!!	1
	!.i was not sure i was going to purchase this kindle, because in my opinion at least, kindle 2 was not a great improvement over kindle 1.  i thought i might appreciate the larger screen, so i decided to try it.	1
	i'm really glad i did.	1
	the larger screen makes this much more like reading a book, and the graphics are even cleaner and sharper than in prior versions.	1
	i like the fact that all the navigation buttons are on one side, as one who is prone to pressing things inadvertently!	1
	the pdf features are amazing -- very easy to work with.	1
	the screen rotates from portrait to landscape orientation when you turn the device (although you can lock it), which is really helpful when looking at certain graphics.	1
	all in all, even though this device is more expensive, it is the one i will recommend to family and friends who are contemplating an ebook reader.	1
	the whole day has gone by, and i am still not done discovering the features of my kindle dx.	1
	it has a significantly different feel (certainly weighs more!	1
	); the keyboard buttons ae smaller and a little harder to use.	1
	but these are the only things i can find to complain about!	1
	the kindle dx is a thing of beauty;  i can't wait to see if i can really get any textbooks for it.	1
	if yo can only afford one kindle, this is the one!      	1
	on the right track.e-reader technology is just starting to find its way in the consumer market.	1
	the best thing i can say about the kindle dx is it delivers on amazon's promises: their marketing is quite honest and accurate.	1
	the dx does what they say it will do: it has a nice large display, and for people like myself who have impaired vision it's great to be able to adjust the typeface to whatever size is most comfortable.	1
	the dx is a bit heavy and ungainly compared to the smaller kindle 2, but that's the trade-off we make for the larger display.	1
	the dx is remarkably easy to use.	1
	it's nice to find a gadget that does a great job without being ridiculously complicated.	1
	unfortunately it might be a little too simple.	1
	with the potential to store over 3,000 books it's really necessary to have some way to organize things - even just the ability to put books into categories would be a huge help.	1
	while amazon does have a lot of e-books available, again it is often very difficult to narrow a search to just the things you want.	1
	the list of search categories on the menu is woefully inadequate, so unless you are a major book-browsing nut like i am, prepare to be somewhat frustrated as you search for the titles you want.	1
	also you will find a lot of titles placed in the wrong categories, and a lot of duplicate entries for titles.	1
	for me personally the selection of books online is a bit limited, but i read a lot of off-the-wall stuff like literary criticism, logic and set theory, and classics.	1
	the prices for the few academic titles that are available are shockingly high - as expensive as the print versions.	1
	the quality of the low-cost titles is poor: most don't have selectable tables of contents, and the formatting can be very crude and haphazard.	1
	i realize one shouldn't expect too much from a two-dollar purchase, but if amazon wants to maintain their market lead, and show-off their reader to best advantage, they should put some kind of quality control in place.	1
	the kindle dx itself is a well designed, well made little gadget that really does what it's supposed to.	1
	the unit is solid and does not have that cheap plastic feel a lot of consumer electronics have.	1
	amazon makes these things to last.	1
	my only real criticisms are the lack of display contrast (dark gray text on a light gray background) and how tough it is to get a comfortable grip on the thing.	1
	i have fairly large hands, and they start to cramp after a half-hour of pinching the very very thin dx between my fingers.	1
	the leather folio cover i purchased from m-edge relieves this somewhat.	1
	but these are really minor problems: just flood your reading environment with light and don't be afraid to put your thumbs on the glass display - it's sturdy.	1
	five hundred bucks is a lot for something like this, but when you're dealing with very new technology it's just going to cost a lot.	1
	for the future i would hope amazon will lower the price, improve display contrast, implement some kind of organizational system, and improve .pdf display.	1
	handling the .epub format natively would also be a good move, as the competition is doing so and you can get a lot of low-cost and free books in this format.	1
	i understand amazon's desire to make their store the main resource for books - but they will lose business to nook, sony, and irex unless they stay competitive.	1
	bottom line: a solid 'a' grade.	1
	get one - this is the future of reading.	1
	tablet computers won't be able to compete when it comes to battery life, ease of use (no drivers, applications, constant upgrades, etc.	1
	), and focus on features the reading public wants.      	1
	useful for novels, useless for some non-fiction.	1
	happy kindle dx owner.	1
	why i sent it back.	1
	the best for diabities or vision impared..the best for diabetes or vision impaired.	1
	i've read most of the reviews.	1
	yes the major con is cost.	1
	you can buy a computer for the cost of this.	1
	that is the only thing i found negative.	1
	i am diagnosed diabetic.	1
	i suffer with my vision chaining as fast as hourly.	1
	reading with trifocals or bifocals becomes a strain to look down the entire time.	1
	have to rest my eyes every 30 minutes or so.	1
	that takes all the fun out of reading.	1
	with the kindle dx i can read without my glasses and just increase or decrease the font as my eyes need it.	1
	it is great.	1
	i got it 3 weeks ago and am still on the same initial charge.	1
	battery shows half used up.	1
	i turn it off when done and turn off the wireless after a purchase.	1
	not sure i would buy for work related or as a student, go buy a laptop for the cost.	1
	even with the cost being difficult to accept.	1
	i would do it again in a heartbeat.	1
	hope you enjoy as much as i have	1
	amazon drm and online bookshelf.i was very excited to hear that amazon was releasing a kindle dx that could view pdf documents native as well as expand into text books.	1
	however, i will no longer purchase any content from amazon until they have worked out their digital rights management (drm) issues.after doing a lot of research and digging into what formats the kindle supported i came across postings from multiple people that were long time kindle users who had problems downloading their previously purchased content onto their new kindle.	1
	as it turns out from the posts (i found a number of unique accounts on multiple sites and postings), in the fine print of your license agreement for the purchase of material from amazon; there may be a limit to the number of times you can download content that you purchased from your amazon bookshelf to your kindle.	1
	apparently once you reach this 'number' (and there is no way to determine how many times you have downloaded it or how close you are to your limit) you will need to repurchase the book if you would like to download it again.	1
	thus 'resetting' the number of times you can download that copy.for me, the fact that i could not download content i purchased to my registered kindle devices as many times as i would like, is enough for me to not purchase a kindle.	1
	i have rather started looking into the irex iliad more seriously.i am not asking you take what i have written here as gospel and to not purchase a kindle based on what i have said here... i do ask that you do some research before making a decision so that you are not surprised by this little 'issue' after you have amassed hundreds of dollars in books that you can no longer read.      	1
	more than the 6' kindle's big brother.i was one of the first people to buy the original kindle.	1
	i was also among the first to buy the 2nd generation kindle.	1
	and yes, i am among the first to buy the kindle dx.	1
	obviously, i really love the product!	1
	the dx is the most expensive in the kindle family.	1
	it is also much larger than the original.	1
	the screen size of the dx is the same size as the entire small kindle and its leather case.	1
	that's the reason it is worth the substantial price tag.	1
	consider.	1
	how would you like to read the 'wall street journal' in a paperback book format?	1
	i tried by subscribing on the original kindle.	1
	it wasn't a satisfying experience.	1
	yes, i got to read the journal, which i love, but what a pain moving from article to article or trying to get the sense of reading a newspaper.	1
	the 'new york times' was worse.	1
	a newspaper is created to be read in a multi-column format.	1
	the dx has a feature that makes reading a newspaper feel like...reading a newspaper.	1
	if you turn the dx on its side, the display goes from a portrait view to landscape.	1
	you can see multiple columns in a newsapaper!	1
	you can see (albeit in black-and-white) the picture on the front page.	1
	if you use your kindle for book reading, you can enlarge the type and not have to click the 'next' button every few seconds.	1
	if you are a student, the dx page is the same size as most text books.	1
	you can read and study with ease.	1
	you can also highlight important sections.	1
	on the minus side, the dx costs a lot and is larger and heavier than the original.	1
	personally, i don't mind the extra size and weight.	1
	it is still wafer thin and lighter than most hard cover books.	1
	if you care, it has increased memory so you can keep up to 3,500 books available.	1
	i think i woudl be bankrupt long before i could fill up that much memory.	1
	if you use the dx for school or work, the ability to search the entire collection of books and documents in the dx is amazing.	1
	there is one other feature of the dx that could turn out to be super-helpful: the ability to import and read pdf files.	1
	for example, the service manual of my car is several thousand pages long.	1
	i have it in pdf form.	1
	i can upload it to my kindle dx (the dx is the only kindle that can read pdf files) and search for the information i want about my car.	1
	that's cool.	1
	if you are considering your first kindle and can afford the extra cost, the dx is absolutely the best electronic book reader ever made.	1
	for a couple of hundred less, you can get the 2nd generation kindle which does a great job with books.	1
	if you plan to use your kindle for text books, journals, magazines, or newspapers; the dx will make you much happier.	1
	after more than two years of kindle ownership, i give this wonderful family of devices five stars!      	1
	no sd card slot nor replaceable battery and limited whispernet coverage equal deal breakers.	1
	dx is the winner.after using irex, sony, kindle 2, i can safely say that kindle dx is a clear winner.	1
	previously, sony had best resolution, irex with decent pdf support and kindle with its wireless convenience and dictionary.	1
	kindle dx gives me all.	1
	its native pdf conversion is very good and display better than i expected even for non-english documents.i always found sony's contrast and display better than kindle 2 but kindle dx screen looks as good if not better.	1
	its mp3 and audible player sounds as good as ipod.of course it is bigger and heavier.	1
	a card slot'd have been better and a built-in light like sony, but kindle dx delivers without putting a dent in your wallet.       	1
	very happy with the kindle dx.i have had the kindle dx for a couple of months and i am very happy with it.	1
	i did a lot of research before deciding to buy a kindle and deciding on the dx.	1
	some of the reasons i chose the dx are that i would be reading the usa today on it (newspapers are better on dx), i do not travel much so the (i believe) very reasonable size would not be an issue, and the pdf capabilities.	1
	usa today is great on the dx, the size is such a non-issue that i do not think i would even like the smaller screen of the kindle 2 and the pdf support is very useful.	1
	a few of the features (not necessarily exclusive to the dx) that i like are: 1) all of my reading in one place/ one thing to take with me to have anything i want to read available.2) the convenience of the kindle dx has definitely increased the amount i read.3) can see it as a very useful tool for work if i choose to convert certain docs to pdf so i have them with me at all times.	1
	4) smooth integration with amazon's kindle store.	1
	the seamless shopping and purchasing experience is very similar to itunes.5) very easy on the eyes.	1
	the digital ink and the large dx screen make for a very enjoyable experience.6) very long battery life.	1
	having to either recharge often or be near an outlet would be a big hassle.7) top notch customer support.	1
	i did have an issue of a book that i purchased not loading to my kindle.	1
	i called after 10pm est, and the rep was knowledgeable, courteous, and quick to fix my issue.8) way more convenient than reading something on my laptop.	1
	only negative i might run into:* a better way to organize the content on the kindle.	1
	i have not reviewed what appear to be the limited options for addressing this but it could be any issue as content increases.	1
	i also feel the need to address a couple of the common complaints i see.	1
	i am not some kindle fan boy, just a fairly logical thinker that does not understand some of the complaints:* it is too expensive - it certainly isn't cheap, but if it was too expensive you would not have purchased it.	1
	the price is clearly stated - not a surprise.	1
	if it is too expensive, someone can consider the kindle 2 or online   content on their computer.	1
	* it is too big - clear dimensions are provided.	1
	it is a simple trade off - my iphone (for example) is much smaller, but not very enjoyable to read on.	1
	i do not feel like i am holding a chalkboard when i am reading, it is    smaller than a magazine.	1
	* it does not come with a cover - did it state that it came with one?	1
	some people seemingly expect too much from everything.	1
	something does what it says, but it is often not enough for people.	1
	the one thing that someone definitely should consider before buying one is if they truly love the feel of a book in their hands and the process of flipping pages as they read.	1
	this is a legitimate concern.	1
	i, on the other hand, prefer a button instead of a page turn, not having my kids lose my book mark and having all of my content in one place.        	1
	good ereader...needs work though.i would have rated it a bit higher but since the rating system doesn't allow partial stars i sided with caution and rated it lower.	1
	good ereader - feels solid, responsive (even with 1000-page pdfs), have been able to find most books i'm interested in reading, and battery life if phenomenal (if i leave wireless off).	1
	i would certainly recommend the dx to anyone who's looking for a good ereader, but you have to know the areas which i feel there could be improvement within...and maybe at the same time justifying the price.	1
	so that brings me to the list of 'could have done better in...'1.	1
	price: for what it does the price is a bit on the high side...something near the price of the kindle 2 would have been more reasonable.2.	1
	web browser: very difficult to navigate and clunky.	1
	i understand the technology behind it is for mobile devices so i'm not expecting a miracle but it definitely on my wishlist that it's improved upon.	1
	being the link is under 'experimental', i hope they are actively working on improving the browser.3.	1
	mp3 playback: not that i use it a whole lot but more advanced feature such as even a playlist would have been nice.	1
	again, the feature is under 'experimental' so there you go.4.	1
	software: i guess it would be categorized under possibly the firmware used.	1
	unlike with the sony ereaders, the kindles don't offer a whole lot of choices in terms on how to categorize your reading material.	1
	for instance, i may have a number of work pdfs that i'd like separated into a category, but the kindle doesn't offer that capability.	1
	you can sort, but you basically tied to what are considered 'personal documents' and 'books'.	1
	hoping that'll change in the near future.	1
	overall i'm happy with the purchase, but when i think of the features (excluding the experimental ones) included, i'm dumbfounded at the price.	1
	however, i bought it, and intend on keeping it, based on the fact that i think amazon has a good platform for improvements.	1
	no downloads to worry about, no upgrades, it just will send you updates as they're available.	1
	i hope i'm right (fingers crossed).       	1
	sleep deprived in nc!.i have looked at and longed for a kindle since they first came out.	1
	my husband bought the dx for me for my birthday.	1
	it arrived yesterday.	1
	i can't express how much i love it!	1
	i was on the fence about the kindle because i thought it may feel cold when reading electronically as opposed to reading a traditional book.	1
	i have always been a reader and have bought, shared and traded books with friends.	1
	i also love the warm and fuzzy feeling of curling up with a good book and turning the pages.	1
	if your concern is that you will lose the physical, emotional and tactile joys of reading by using the kindle, worry no more.	1
	i have the leather cover for my kindle, and reading with the cover looks and feels like a regular book.	1
	i couldn't be more happy.	1
	i stayed up into the wee hours of the morning learning to use all the bells and whistles.	1
	now i need to figure out what to do with my stack of bookmarks!!	1
	another concern could be the initial investment of $500+ for the reader and cover.	1
	for the serious reader, the savings for kindle purchases will reach the breakeven point with the purchase price at somewhere around 50 books -- not a bad return by my calculations.	1
	thanks, amazon!	1
	!      	1
	kindle dx sets the standard!.i've researched ebook readers since the old fashioned crappy e books that you have to have special software to read on your computer...before the kindle 1 was even released (or designed).	1
	i had been close to pulling the trigger on a kindle at every evolution of the product.	1
	the day i had decided to purchase the kindle 2, the dx was being promo'd for it's june release.	1
	the additional capabilities...screen size, direct .pdf support, and ability to view in landscape were deal closers for me.	1
	i can happily say that the product has exceeded my expectations in every category.	1
	i heavily read manuals of one form or another.	1
	they often have diagrams or images that require viewing to completely capture understanding of the text.	1
	having the ability to zoom into a .pdf by viewing in landscape is a blessing.	1
	although it would be nicer if you could do a true 'zoom in' to view those really condense .pdf documents.	1
	i'll be buying one of these (maybe the smaller kindle 2)for my mother when she visits me in the near future, as she is an avid reader and will enjoy the convenience and smaller size.      	1
	my thoughts.	1
	if you like to read you need a kindle.if you love to read, you should buy a kindle.	1
	if you plan to read only novels on the kindle then you probably don't need the dx, but i love the bigger size, even for novels.	1
	i absolutely love my dx.	1
	i see a book or hear about a new book coming out and in a minute i can be reading it.	1
	i can read multiple books and never lose my place.	1
	i will never buy the same book twice by mistake.	1
	i can pre order a book and when it comes out, it will be on your kindle ready to read.	1
	i did this with dan browns new book.when i don't have my kindle, i can open up on of my kindle books, on my iphone and start reading from the same place i was last reading on the kindle.	1
	i do this more frequently then i would have thought.	1
	books in pdf form, typically have a border around the text and these types of books are not worth reading on the dx.	1
	but if the pdf is formatted without a large white border around the content, then the kindle works great.	1
	rotating the dx to read a pdf in landscape mode is pretty worthless.	1
	the kindle view does not sync up with the book's page boundaries.	1
	you end up paging to the space between pages with the page number.	1
	you have a few lines before and a few lines after.	1
	this does not work for me.	1
	i would prefer to have the next page button move down until the end of the pdf page is reached, then the next page button push would go to the top of the next pdf page.  	1
	kindle dx.love it!	1
	a little larger and heavier than i thought, but it sure beats holding a 1500 mitchner novel.	1
	love receiving two newspapers everday, sans the advertisements.	1
	sure wish it had color though &lt;smile>.	1
	kindle dx is good for travellers.the dx is the largte full size page kindle.	1
	i like to use it but frankly it isn't as nice as a real book.	1
	it is a little awkward to hold but that isn't a major deterrent to using it.	1
	i would like it to have a 'backlighting' feature, so that you ocuold read it without having to switch on a light at night.	1
	as to capacity and the download feature, it is amazing how quick and easy it is.	1
	a full book takes a couple of minutes.	1
	the whisper net works effortlessly and far more easily than, say, your phone downloads.	1
	everything is preprogrammed so there is no thinking or reading of intsructions to be done.	1
	you simply select your title and hit the buy button.	1
	i have downloaded some samples books and the criticism i have is that i can't work out how to delete them!the instrction book is huge and very difficult to use.	1
	it tells you far more than you need to know and you can't find the things that you really need, like deleting items, easily.the expand-the-font feature is truly great, because i sometimes need to go to the largest font if light is poor.battery life seems very long.	1
	i have yet to fun out of gas on it.all in all, i can recommend it thouroughly.	1
	but holding a real book in my hands still cannot be beaten.      	1
	need improve features for professional reading.in general, 9.7 inches' screen is big enough for reading, especially for a4 size professional documents.	1
	if you have complex documents with large pictures embeded, dx is more desirable than 6 inches' screen reader.	1
	the design is delicate, also the native pdf support is a big progress.	1
	for general reading i'd say i like it.	1
	but for efficient professional reading, it is absolutely another thing.	1
	for professional reading, merely a big screen doesn't help much, the most usabilities come from perticular features of software.	1
	after days of using, here are some critical issues for professional reading i found, mainly i'm talking about pdf, but they also apply to kindle book: 1. index support, bookmark with meaningful text label: professional reading is not simply reading page by page slowly, people jump among sections and check references much often, so they need to mark content with helpful labels, also people certainly need to make use of index if it is already there.	1
	now nothing can be done to pdf on kindle dx, there is 'bookmark', but it's no use to mark a page with page number, how can people know the meaning of page 2, 6 or 9?	1
	also going to a bookmark is tedious, people need to click many times to go to a page: menu button->scroll down->my bookmarks->scroll down->choose a bookmark, this is very inefficient, at most one click is sufficient enough to pop up a bookmarks list.	1
	there are so many keys there, dx should take its advantage to allow shortcuts (and it's better allow customizing by user, also, if it is possible to goto particular bookmark with one click that's great, e.g.	1
	alt+number?	1
	), and also consider add backward/forward between bookmarks.	1
	sometine this is very usefull.	1
	2. cross-book reference: professional reading is a process of studying and checking references, people need to make references between books easily, so it needs to think how to switch bettwen books quickly, e.g.	1
	using tabbed window, popup books list window without requesting user being away from current book's reading, etc.	1
	i guess if it is possible to switch between bookmars among books, that would be great.	1
	3. please consider to let user choose contrast: i find out sometime when i'm reading scanned pdf file, the text color is very dim.	1
	mostly this is obvious when there is picture embeded in the page.	1
	this should be bug.	1
	but also, isn't it ideal to let people choose the contrast?	1
	also, i agree with the points from other guys, e.g.	1
	dx lacks support for particular pdf content, and things like zooming, it is required especially for 2-3 columns pdf file.	1
	and sometime content relay is also one good solution.	1
	i think if kindle dx is only aimed to be used as a text or fiction reader, then in most cases it is no more than a waste.	1
	6-inch kindle 2 is sufficient enough for this purpose, and it's more portable.	1
	the hardware is ideal for professional reading and amazon also is willing it can be widely accepted in university or office for professional purpose, but the efficiency of reading on kindle dx is still far from ideal, frankly, except bigger screen, i didn't see much difference in usability of this one from a 6 inch product that is released 2 years ago.	1
	i guess you will receive many feedbacks about issues in professional usage.	1
	without good features - in fact i don't think it's hard to program them, it's not easy to satisfy users.       	1
	bookworm.i have owned the 6 inch kindle as well as the 9.7 inch kindle.	1
	i read so many books that i am thoroughly enjoying not having to stockpile so many hard copy books.	1
	i loved the 6 inch kindle, but since my eyes are older, i decided to try the larger size.	1
	the larger print, sharper pictures and the number of books that you can store on the kindle dx are all pluses.	1
	i had gotten accustomed to the previous and next pages being on both sides on the 6 inch kindle.	1
	it took me a while to get use to it being on the right side only.	1
	this may be a problem for left-hand people.	1
	overall, i love the kindle dx and have recommended it to many of my friends.	1
	several have already purchased it after flipping through mine.	1
	much better than netbook or kindle 2.i read mostly novels and ilustradet technical pdfs.	1
	my kindle 2 which i used for one week was perfect for novels.	1
	very handy.	1
	but for pdf screen was definitely too small.	1
	so i get dx.	1
	cost, packaging to poland.total cost paid was sum of device, handling and shipping multiplied with 1,22 for 22% polish vat tax.	1
	shipping to poland takes three workdays.	1
	feel and ergonomy.like heavy plastic but nice.	1
	with leather case is nicer but heavier.	1
	ergonomy for one hand using is worse than kindle 2 for twice weight and buttons only on the right.	1
	i recommend going to gym, so weight problem will be eliminated.	1
	overal comfort is better than with real paper book.	1
	screen contrast.dx according to web reviews should have higher screen contrast.	1
	i didn't found any difference.	1
	screen contrast is a little low in fluorescent, lightsaving light and very good at daylight, sun or cloudy light.	1
	novels.kindle 2 was a little more handy for novels.	1
	here page turns are twice less, but it's heavier and really there is no need for bigger screen.	1
	but for fast reading it's better than k2.	1
	for novel only reading and money saving i would recomend kindle 2. pdf.technical pdf files can be read without conversion in vertical position.	1
	however for big a4 (210x297mm) ilustrated, tables i switch to horizontal for better comfort display.	1
	quality and ergonomy is good.	1
	i like it.	1
	sometimes with windows vista ulimate there is a problem copying large files to kindle and file is copied with errors.	1
	i find the solution: create folder, put pdf in it, copy folder to kindle.	1
	same problems i had with kindle 2. converted pdf to mobi.i converted some text only pdf, some with little ilustrations using calibre software.	1
	quality was good but paragraphs and line ends was a mess sometimes.	1
	i prefer converted documents with errors for control over text than original pdfs.	1
	wireless internet in poland.it works as advertised with 3g network.	1
	book download is less than a minute.	1
	internet access is limited to amazon.com and [...] only.	1
	battery.battery lasted for two intensive use days with everything turned on.	1
	when i switched wireless and position detector off my battery show 50% after two weeks (1-2 hours daily) and two novel books.	1
	it's really too good for my use.	1
	filesystem.i hope amazon in next software versions will include folders.	1
	there is no use for 3,5 gb memory right now.	1
	to stay organized it's better to delete books and keep only what's necessary.	1
	what i want in next software releases?1.	1
	ability to turn off grayscale in order to have more contrast in some pdf which are displayed now as bad quality grayscale.2.	1
	filesystem with folders!	1
	an old friend gets an upgrade.i've loved reading since i was very small, and i will always love the feel of a book.	1
	nothing can replace the simplicity of opening a page and immediately being engaged.	1
	so when other companies have come forward with their favorite 'readers' and 'ebooks', the idea of abandoning the comfortable and familiar did not appeal.	1
	all of the other devices seemed to be more like laptoppy, console-ish gadgets that just happened to mimic opening a pdf on a computer.	1
	i am pleased to say that the kindle is anything *but* an imitative gadget.	1
	most of the problems surrounding e-readers involve the fact that they focus more on adapting books to technology:  kindle realized the best way was instead to adapt technology to the book.	1
	the kindle is slim, lightweight, and easy to handle.	1
	the tiny keyboard beneath the screen is secondary and seldom needed.	1
	the point of it all is to make the experience just like your bookshelf in the real world:  see, open, read.	1
	what sealed the deal for me was getting to see the kindle's screen:  this is not a touch-screen, it's not back-lit, and it's not designed for hd-quality video.	1
	instead it reminds me of the warm, friendly feeling i used to get looking at the early macintosh computers from apple:  it's taken grayscale and made it as clean as possible.	1
	we're a long way from the '80s, though, so the e-ink screen has to be much better than any black-and-white crt.	1
	as luck would have it, it is:  when you hold a kindle in your hand, the screen really looks like a piece of paper.	1
	you can easily adjust the contrast and font size to your liking (default has the white just slightly muted into a light gray), and the dx will auto-tilt from portrait to landscape (or even upside-down!)	1
	--it does this better than my phone.	1
	you'd be surprised how very sharp images can be rendered in shades of gray:  illustrations, diagrams, and pictures truly look quite good on the reading surface.	1
	so how about the rest?	1
	we have a global wireless network that, while not saturating the planet, certainly seems to have a lot of coverage:  my little town has connectivity far out to the remote areas, and i'm sure big cities fare even better.	1
	speeds vary constantly, from the feel of 'slow dial-up' to 'low-level broadband' and the network signal meter will show a '3g' logo when it's accessing at 3g speeds.	1
	speed really shouldn't be an issue, however--remember that books are typically rather small files and any sites you browse should be the mobile-enabled versions and/or oriented mostly towards text.	1
	i told you i've been an avid reader from an early age.	1
	what i haven't told you is that for many years now, i've felt hampered by books.	1
	i buy books to read for pleasure, and have to bury them beneath the books that guide my career.	1
	computer books are heavy, bulky, biblically-dense things, and they quickly fall out of favor, to be replaced by the next printing.	1
	with the kindle came a way to keep the best of both worlds.	1
	i load pdfs of my computer books off the cd-roms that came with them and they render very cleanly.	1
	i have an o'reilly safari online account, and the kindle browses to it easily, showing me any of the online technical references on my virtual bookshelf.	1
	i also easily purchased a few favorite books from amazon just for fun, then went out to project gutenberg and pulled down some of the greatest works of literature from human history.	1
	i've even got an audiobook of l. frank baum's 'the marvelous land of oz'.	1
	i also have the register, the inquirer, and cnet on my bookmarks (for work) with google news, bbc, and cnn (for 'fun').	1
	the end result is that i no longer feel like i'm letting books go:  instead i feel that it's easier to take them with me, and it's a joyful experience.	1
	so how does using a kindle compare to actually reading a book?	1
	it's really 'close enough for comfort'.	1
	the lightweight, thin frame and the easy 'next page/previous page' buttons make reading very seamless.	1
	you can leave a book and it will remember your place, or you can manually set bookmarks and the kindle will remember where they are.	1
	navigating menus is managed with a simple thumb-stick and a 'menu' button.	1
	purchasing books via the amazon store really does take less than a minute from end to end.	1
	and i'm pleased to report that if you don't want to wade through the tedium of connecting the usb cable to a computer and copy/pasting files over, you can just e-mail them to your kindle's e-mail address.	1
	the kindle will add them to your library very quickly--i was impressed with how fast it grabbed large technical documents i sent and made them ready-to-read (you should know that e-mailing books to yourself will incur a small fee from amazon for use of the whispernet service).	1
	thus far there's only one real drawback i've found with my kindle:  the browser, while adequate, is still not quite finished.	1
	it's in the kindle menu under 'experimental', and amazon asks for your feedback for good reason.	1
	i've had a couple of lockups that were made worse by the fact that reopening the browser after a reset defaults to trying to hit the last page...the page that locked it up.	1
	i've also had a couple of websites just fizzle out and stop working for whatever reason (i'm going to send amazon detailed information about this).	1
	thankfully, rebooting is as simple as holding the power button for 4 seconds and releasing, then pressing again to turn back on.	1
	resetting the unit doesn't destroy anything:  it just moves you back to the kindle home screen.	1
	and resetting is as easy has holding that same power button for 15 seconds instead of 4. if you're looking at something to help you take reading with you, that is versatile and can cross worlds to news sites, audiobooks, or just manually keeping track of a ton of documents, you should give the kindle a try.	1
	reading is easy, the screen is very clean, and the lack of a backlight isn't a let-down so much as an easement to the eyes--if i had the choice, i'd rather spend hours staring at paper than watching millions of tiny lightbulbs glowing back at me.	1
	while i chose the dx for its larger screen, i have seen the smaller unit and it does equally well--apart from the screen size, they truly do appear to be almost identical.      	1
	wonderful!!	1
	!.i recieved my dx january 20!	1
	well i do own the k2 6' as well, which my daughter and husband use regularly.	1
	my dear sweet husband bought it for me and i love the larger screen.	1
	i do plan to use it for school as long as the text books are available for the courses i'm taking.	1
	the best this is today while in class i didnt have my notes my professor emailed to us the night before.	1
	so guess what i did i pulled up the email on my blackberry and emailed the notes to my kindle and with in seconds there they were on my kindle dx graphs and all!	1
	now tell that isn't fabulous!      	1
	wonderful, all kindles can be 'international'.i was using the kindle 2 but needed the dx for larger pdf files (e.g.	1
	medical journal articles such as new england journal of medicine).	1
	ebook readers are 'lifestyle' machines that completely change the way you do research, pleasure reading, work, etc.	1
	firstly besides the convenience of getting the kindle books (which you can also do with kindle for the pc or for the ipod) the kindle is not fatigueing on the eyes the way an lcd screen is.	1
	secondly, even the kindle dx is light enough for use anywhere for instance in the subway in nyc.	1
	thirdly, if you have a us credit card and billing address no matter what country you are in you can download a kindle book and then transfer it to your kindle via usb cable.	1
	thus, at least for americans the kindle is truly international regardless of which country you are in.	1
	fourth, check out blogs such as [...] for much added help about how to use your reader.	1
	it is really great that you can get all of the works of shakespeare for [...], jane austin, [...], mark twain, [...], etc.      	1
	i never thought....	1
	love my dx!.	1
	satisfied customer.	1
	kindle.	1
	great product.	1
	not perfect yet, but getting there.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	very pleased.	1
	wonderful product.	1
	best purchase ever.	1
	i wish the kindle could....i love my kindle.	1
	one suggestion i have is that i wish you could mark the books as having been read.	1
	i have numerous titles on my home page, some of which i have read and others that i haven't.	1
	i have to open the books to determione if i have read them or not.       	1
	the best!.	1
	superb--kindle dx.	1
	non kindle pdf files.	1
	kindle dx is great!.	1
	i can't live without it!	1
	it's a bookstore at your finger-tips!.	1
	space saving and easy to use.	1
	medical student seal-of-approval.	1
	not too shabby......	1
	happy with purchase.i'll keep this short and sweet.... i haven't had the product for very long, but overall i'm happy with my purchase.negatives: it's a bit pricey, you can't share or return old books for any type of reimbursement or small fee,  it's a little heavier then i expected, not a fan of the on/off/hibernation key (very small and it feels like it could break), and there is no light for reading in the dark.	1
	positives: the look of the page is awesome (just like real paper), instant gratification you can download a book when/where you want it (no waiting), it's thin and doesn't take up much room - easy to carry, the built in dictionary is a cool feature - like the test items and basic internet functionality, the battery power lasts a long time, you can read it in the sunlight with no issues, and the rotation and font functionality is a nice thing to have.      	1
	pdfs and other complaints.so many reviewers have complained about the failure of the dx to always and consistently render pdfs the way they would like to see them.	1
	margins, font size, general formating, etc.	1
	i think these people should spring for some version of 'pdfs for dummies' before complaining.	1
	they would then learn that how pdfs are handled is largely under the control of the individual or the entity that created the pdf in the first place.	1
	in short, pdfs are not text files that are easily manupulated like an ebook, and pdf fonts and formating can be preserved as the creator initially rendered them, regardless of the platform on which they are displayed.	1
	authors frequently do this to ensure that their work is presented as they originally intended it to be seen.	1
	so please try to cut amazon and the dx some slack on this.	1
	that is not to suggest there is no room for improvement, because there is, but some of what is being complained about is out of amazon's control.	1
	as far as pricing is concerned, amazon is only charging about 50% above their actual cost for the components that go into the kindle, and that's a fair and pretty standard markup.	1
	these componets will eventually come down in price.	1
	when they do, the price will reflect that, but for now you are talking about bleeding edge technology and costs reflect that.	1
	just think of costing the device over time.	1
	if i keep my k2 for one year, it has only cost me $1 per day, and that's a pretty good deal.	1
	regarding the complaints about book pricing, those prices are controlled by the publishers -- not amazon -- so if you're not happy with them, complain to the publisher.	1
	especially complain about the cost of digital versions vs. physical hard copy.	1
	i understand that authors still need to be paid and publishers need their cut, and i understand that these costs are the bulk of the price.	1
	what i don't understand is that the publishers are not taking into account the reduction in cost through savings on paper, ink, bindings, warehousing, and shipping.	1
	we should hit the publishers hard on this.	1
	and by all means, keep hitting amazon hard over the lack of folders to manage your downloads and the rediculous decision to use a non-user replaceable battery.	1
	and no, i don't work for amazon or any of it's affiliates, and they didn't pay me to write this.      	1
	poor pdf support.	1
	not quite worth buying, at least not yet..first off, i own a kindle dx, have had it since it came out.	1
	originally i was really excited, as i had switch from an irex illiad, which if not for the digitizer built in would be my most hated device ever, especially after dealing with irex.	1
	the dx is sleek, a bit heavy but sleek, i like the weighted feel and the display for reading purposes is absolutely amazing, easy on the eyes.	1
	the pdf capabilities, while they could be better, like adding zooming or font resizing, are still pretty good, especially with the big screen size.	1
	however i have several issue with the device, all of which in my mind can be fixed in software, whether or not amazon does it is a different story.	1
	problem one: no epub support, this is going to be a big issue as more and more content is being released in this format.	1
	i'm not saying they need to sale there books in this format, but they should support it.	1
	if you don't think this is a big issue it will be as google, along with other ebook and device vendors, are putting a lot of weight and content behind this format, not having it will heavily limit content access.	1
	problem two: there is no way to organize content, this is a huge issue.	1
	not having a folders for sorting content is just insane, it's not a big deal till you load 100+ documents on the device, and at 500+ yeah forget about it.	1
	this basic feature is a must considering you should be able to store roughly 3500 documents.	1
	you can sort by author or title, pdf's only have titles.	1
	problem three: i know this one seems petty, but it quickly gets annoying, the lack of user settings for the screen saver image.	1
	i don't know why amazon insist that i want to look at pictures of jane austen and friends, there are several authors in the stack that i really hate advertising for.	1
	nothing against them just a personal preference, i feel the screen saver is reflection on my personal taste.	1
	this is a good example of the vendor deciding that you paying them $500 means they have the right to advertise their favorite authors as your own and not giving the option to either disabling it or better yet choosing your own.	1
	i consider this a basic feature.	1
	would i buy it, uh, with epub support, yeah, without no.	1
	some things would be nice, touch screen, a development kit, etc.	1
	but my issue with the device as you can see range from minor but annoying lack of settings, to what is quickly becoming a lack of support for standards.	1
	this is my opinion of course, but hey that's the point of a review, maybe amazon will read it and fix it, maybe they won't.      	1
	you'll never go back.i've been wanting a kindle since they came out but waited until they had gone through a few versions and finally my partner bought me the dx this june.	1
	if you've been wanting one but just not sure, let me reassure you: you will not regret it, you will love it, and you will read more than you're reading now.	1
	there's been a lot of ebook reader, and especially kindle press lately that hasn't been positive - a new yorker article this week about the kindle 2 (did they let that sit on their shelves for a year before publishing?	1
	they couldn't swing for a dx for the reviewer?)	1
	and this morning on npr.	1
	the gist of the negativity seems to come down to a sort of 'sky is falling' fear that ebook readers mean the end of books as we know them.	1
	and perhaps it's true: as more people go with ebook readers fewer will purchase books.	1
	but why fight the tide?	1
	there are so many, many benefits to them: 1. when you travel, you just have one, very small, very light, object you take with you.2.	1
	when you hear a review or remember a book you've always wanted to read, you download it.	1
	(i just downloaded uncle tom's cabin and the jungle book for free!	1
	i probably would never have thought to buy them in the store, i certainly would not have read them from my computer, and there's no way to have gotten the physical books for free.)3.	1
	i've had a new yorker subscription for years, and now have a kindle new yorker subscription.	1
	it arrives earlier than the print version, and i can look up those pesky long words they always use with the built-in dictionary.	1
	just move the kindle courser next to a word you don't know and the definition appears at the bottom of the page.4.	1
	when you're at the airport, you log into the kindle store and download that day's new york times for the plane.	1
	$.75 per issue, or get a subscription.	1
	voila!	1
	you're reading the current nyt on the plane, no messy fingers, no bumping your neighbor's arm as you turn the page, no adding to the land fill.	1
	the only downside, and this is a biggie, is you can't share books.	1
	i loved handing off a book or magazine to a friend.	1
	that's not possible any longer.	1
	probably the future will be that we send recomendations for downloads to our friends ebook readers.	1
	in the meantime i'm reading more than ever before and loving the kindle.	1
	it's like when email came out and everyone complained that we were all becoming isolated, not talking to people face to face or even on the phone any longer.	1
	but what actually happened was we started staying in touch with people we otherwise would have lost.	1
	kindle will bring more reading into your life, much more.	1
	and this can only help the publishing industry.	1
	march proudly into the brave new world (on the kindle store at $4.79).      	1
	amazon clueless.you'd think that a company that started out online would understand the concept of purchasing a digital download, but amazon is clueless.	1
	the stealing of customers' kindle digital downloads by such a powerful online company undermines the entire concept of owning a digital download.	1
	here's amazon's response as reported by the new york times: 'amazon effectively acknowledged that the deletions were a bad idea.	1
	'we are changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances,'' removing a purchased item from a customer's kindle is not just a 'bad idea.'	1
	it is stealing.	1
	since a kindle digital book can be marked up and annotated, removing it erases all owner work contained in the digital download and could cost the customer thousands of dollars, not to mention the heartache potentially involved.	1
	amazon's action in this case sets a precedent that, if not acknowledged as being illegal, could be followed by sellers of other types of digital downloads.	1
	one could well imagine software companies stealing back a customer's digital download and all of the customer's products generated by its use.	1
	further, amazon's statement that in the future it 'will not remove books from customers' devices in these circumstances' indicates that under different circumstances, it still reserves the right to steal a customer's digital download if it so chooses.	1
	amazon doesn't get it.	1
	amazon is undermining the entire concept of the purchase of a digital download and what it means to own digital products.	1
	this is huge and will have a major impact on the entire industry.	1
	amazon, through jeff bezos and not some company spokesman, should go global with its apology, state that their act was illegal, and that their victims will be compensated for their illegal actions.	1
	this is not going away.	1
	an entire global industry is at risk.	1
	we are all waiting on you, jeff bezos.      	1
	omg!	1
	kindle is the best!.	1
	transitional technology that does not fulfill the hype..	1
	absolutely love it!.i adore my kindle dx.	1
	i was originally torn between the dx and the k2 because of size and weight, but ultimately i decided to go with the dx because i liked the idea of a bigger reading screen, and i loved the native pdf support.	1
	and i haven't regretted it for a moment.	1
	it works exactly as advertised, and i currently have 127 books on my kindle.	1
	i travel a lot for work, so being able to take my entire library with me, and having the ability to get a new book when i'm done with the old one, no matter where i am, has been phenomenal.	1
	the selection of kindle books is huge and growing, and i love that amazon and publishers offer an ever-changing range of freebies.	1
	granted, most of them are the first in a series, to try and entice you to buy the rest, but i've already discovered some new authors and series i never would have tried otherwise, so it's been a great way to expand my horizons a bit.	1
	the one downside i know most of us worry about is the inability to share kindle books.	1
	i don't have an exact solution for it, but i do have a suggestion.	1
	my mother has a k1, bought when they first came out, so we wanted to be able to share books back and forth.	1
	we discovered that, while you can't have a kindle registered to two accounts at the same time, you can de-register and register it to another account without any loss of what's already downloaded.	1
	so we switched accounts, downloaded one another's books - bought legitimately, and you can have books your purchased on more than one device legally!	1
	- then switched back to our own accounts.	1
	now, if you delete it off your kindle, you would have to go back to the other account to grab it again, and it's not a solution to try with someone you don't trust absolutely with access to your account, but for those of you who have a family member who owns a kindle as well, it is one option for sharing that i thought i would share.	1
	not ideal, but it's better than not being able to share at all.	1
	also, i've read reports that some books have a limit imposed by the publishers as to how many devices any one book can be sent to, so it's not an unlimited option, but again, it is a way to share with a few other trusted people if that's what you're looking for.	1
	anyway, anyone out there on the fence about the kindle - it really is fantastic.	1
	i'm an avid reader and book lover, and have been since i was a child.	1
	i don't miss paper copies at all, as my dx reads exactly like a paperback would, it's lighter, it's more portable, and it holds more than any paper book every could.	1
	i highly recommend it to any book lover!      	1
	a lifesaver for reading long pdfs, sitting flat on a table and getting dan brown's latest and the economist on time.the kindle dx is great for reading long pdfs and other electronic docs.	1
	no more squinting at the computer screen or printing out 60 pages to be read once.	1
	i'm a law student and i get cases from lexis and westlaw sent to my kindle for me to read over them whenever i've got the time - makes reading for work or uni much easier people often ask me whether i miss the feel of normal books.	1
	i do a bit, but books on the kindle are much cheaper and one huge counter advantage to regular books is that the kindle sits flat.	1
	for anyone who likes to read while eating or having a coffee, or while typing notes on the computer, this is a simple advantage that i appreciate all the time getting newspapers and the economist wirelessly delivered is great.	1
	for a weekly publication like the economist, it's more satisfying to read it when it's still fresh.	1
	got 'the lost symbol' the day it came out - for cheaper than a regular book and without having to go out of my way to buy it.	1
	i've found i'm reading more now that i have the kindle - it's convenient to have all your reading material sitting on the homepage, tempting you to read a little more each day.	1
	and if you see an emerson quote and want to read the context - flash - you've got the complete works, for less than a dollar, from the wireless kindle store      	1
	kindle protector.	1
	kindle dx.i have been using the kindle dx approximately 2 weeks.	1
	it has been very enjoyable for me, to finish a article at 3 a.m. having the kindle dx read to me that hour of the morning, has been major relief for my tired eyeballs.	1
	the screen is amazing, can turn it in any direction for reading and keep going in any situation.	1
	plus having the option of changing the size of print has been very helpful.	1
	all of its features are accessable, and without the requirement of having to be a scientist.	1
	my dx goes with me when i am out and running errands, have found it very handy should i be delayed and am waiting for my husband.	1
	my husband is very happy that my new books are not collecting more room space, and he doesn't have to think about more bookshelves.	1
	i read alot, and having book space and a new home with the kindle dx, has made acouple dreams come true, for us both.	1
	now i can enjoy a full library, at my finger tips.	1
	it travels with me, the weight is not a problem, and i can read, read, read.......... thankyou amazon, i can hardly wait to see what you come up with for an encore!      	1
	first time e-ink owner.	1
	avid reader.	1
	gadget guy.	1
	mid 30s..before i recieved my dx i had never seen an e-ink reader outside a couple of sonys in a sonystyle store back around december 08.  i am glad i waited for this; it feels like mature technology to me.	1
	i had been waiting to scratch the e-ink itch until pdf support came 'round and i was hoping it would come with a bigger screen than the kindle 1 & 2.  this had all that but i still waited for the first youtube video reviews to decide to buy and then, luckily, one came in the mail the day i was going to buy one.	1
	my fiancee had pre-ordered it for me months ago!	1
	i find it very easy to read even at the 2nd to smallest font level for normal texts.	1
	pdf rendering is fine and i've read through at least 15 different pdf files; probably a few hundred pages.	1
	pdf text is a little smaller but just as legible as it is on even my nicest lcd monitor.	1
	note, however, that pdf pages are scaled 1:1 so you do lose the text functions like resizing, dictionary, highlight and so on that you have in normal text files.	1
	the free conversion service works better than expected.	1
	just email your file as an attachment to customizeable_name@free.kindle.com and you get a free amazon format book back in a matter of 5 minutes max.	1
	i've done at least 6 .html format files so far and they all come out looking just as good as the books i bought on amazon.	1
	i find it easier to get around a newspaper in here than i do a real newspaper and far easier to read/absorb information through kindle reading due to font size and layout.	1
	i've tried the chicago tribune, la times and usa today so far.	1
	the 14 day free trials on all newspapers are an unexpected bonus.	1
	from everything i've read this device should last years without degradation outside battery life.	1
	on rare occasion i notice a little ghosting.	1
	alt+g (refresh) wipes that out every time.	1
	you really have to look for it to see it and i haven't really figured out what makes it more or less likely.	1
	i'm pretty anal retentive so when it happens and i catch it the alt+g trick is nice to have up my sleeve.	1
	i only have two 'complaints'.	1
	one: i do wish the wireless would shut itself down and wake up hourly to check for new content (or at least have the option to use it that way).	1
	it could also switch on when you access the store and switch off when you exit.	1
	i just manually turn it on and off to preserve battery and hopefully battery life.	1
	two: the rotate is too sensitive.	1
	luckily you can turn this off easily through the font key.	1
	overall it still gets five stars.	1
	with a lot of luck they'll kill my two complaints and beef up pdf support in a firmware update but i'm not getting my hopes up.	1
	also, i'm very happy with it even with those flaws.	1
	i've researched and purchased three cases and done reviews on all three of those too... which i think you can get to through clicking on my name here.      	1
	a great ebook/pdf reader for me.	1
	the era of the paper book *will* come to an end..pros:- does everything as advertised- dictionary/google/wikipedia function will help my kids build their vocabulary- screen is beautiful- no eyestrain at all; font can be increased for old/tired eyes- free internet connectivity is a nice plus cons: - expensive (but worth it, to me anyway)- might be too big for some users (but i like the big screen) the elegance and convenience of this device is intoxicating.	1
	my house has too many books; this is going to help clean up all the clutter.	1
	i absolutely love the iphone integration - no more bringing a book to read in long lines etc.	1
	my 75-year-old dad could use this device, too, due to its incredible user-friendliness and the ability to increase the font size.	1
	native pdf compatibility is an extremely nice capability to have - you can easily put any word document on this thing, too (just use a free word->pdf converter, there are plenty out there).	1
	this technology will definitely replace the paper book someday, assuming humanity survives another century or so!      	1
	intuitive and met expectations.i had my dx fully operational and downloading books within two minutes of opening the package that arrived today.	1
	it came personalized with my amazon account name with the wireless already active.	1
	all i had to do was push a few keys.	1
	overall, the unit does live up to it's intuitive design by really simplifying the interface and making it seem more like book but one thats really powerful with huge storage, partial title searches, really fast downloads, etc..  my daughter has stolen the dx and is now reading her first book before lights out.	1
	my wife, who really was turned off by the kindle (and others like it), has now downloaded a title that was unavailable at the library and now has intense interest.	1
	overall, a really expensive literature viewer with the ability to suck more bucks out of my pocket on downloads.	1
	but what a neat device with the typical amazon pro interface and awesome display!	1
	!      	1
	sad to say that it's going back.i own an original kindle and love it ... great technology, great price, great product.	1
	although the kindle 2 looked nice with some decent improvements, i really was very happy with my kindle.	1
	when the dx was announced, i decided to move up.	1
	to make this succinct, here's the good and the not-so-good.	1
	good very clear image.	1
	well thought out button placement.	1
	good tactile feel to the inputs ... that is, the buttons respond with a nice, solid click when pressed.	1
	the ability to set the rotating image to manual because the auto-rotating feature is a pain when it changes in response to slight moves.	1
	battery life is very good.	1
	the track button is a very slick way to navigate the large screen.	1
	it also carries with it all of the features that made the original kindle a winner.	1
	not-so-good it's big.	1
	no, it's really big.	1
	this wouldn't be too bad because you do have to accommodate the large screen but it is also heavy.	1
	i'm 6' tall and no lightweight, but the combined size and weight of this thing make it uncomfortable at best.	1
	when you add a leather cover to protect the fragile screen (see comment below), you are dealing with a very large textbook sized object.	1
	when you look at the picture of two hands holding the dx, don't forget to add the substantial size and weight of a cover to it.	1
	my personal opinion is that it is large and heavy to the point that it is unwieldy.	1
	it might be great for college textbooks (if any exist for it) but not for the average person who wants to just read.	1
	also, if this is amazon's answer for reading newspapers & magazines, i'll stick with the printed pieces.	1
	another not-so-good thing is that i am becoming more concerned about the number of people who report that this thing has a screen that goes on the fritz for no good reason and when they call amazon, they get blamed for abusing the device and are told it will cost $350 to repair/replace.	1
	now, i know that these reviews are replete with dozens of posts from people who dropped a unit and broke the screen, but there are also way too may posts about this dx screen issue to ignore.	1
	finally, i'm not that impressed with the 16 levels of gray images.	1
	they're not bad but they certainly don't live up to the amazon marketing claims.	1
	based on the above, i'm returning the dx.	1
	it's great technology but not a fit for my lifestyle, especially at the very high price.	1
	also, i don't want to risk keeping the unit and having the screen die, only to be told that it will cost me another $350 to fix it (there's too much noise out there about this subject to ignore it and amazon is not addressing the question/problem).	1
	i'll buy a kindle 2 because i already gave my original kindle to my son.      	1
	some poor features for the visually impaired.	1
	kindle dx - a small step forward.i also own a sony prs500.	1
	so i am already familiar with eink technology.	1
	i think that adjusted my expectations for the kindle dx.	1
	the main reason i bought the dx is to read pdf files so that i can carry and read a lot of papers and technical documents (some highly confidential).	1
	this is my experience so far.	1
	hopefully it will help others.	1
	1) reading pdf not all pdf's are the same.	1
	dx can do a pretty good job cutting the margins so that the pdf is display in good size.	1
	but some pdf's are designed to be printed as hard copies.	1
	and they have really fat margins.	1
	so i play around with adobe acrobat to make come up with a workable solution.	1
	if you have the full acrobat version there is a feature to crop the margins (crop pages).	1
	i can trim the margins to a bear minimum and now all my pdf's are very readable in portrait mode.	1
	some pdf's are locked.	1
	i have to find some program for windows that can unlock the pages before i can crop the margins.	1
	just google for unlock pdf.	1
	i also have some pdf's that are about 1000 pages.	1
	dx choked on those.	1
	it just keeps rebooting when i open the files.	1
	i have to split those up to two files.	1
	it might be a function of the files size and/or number of pages.	1
	2) organizing books this is the part that the kindle software is doing a poor job.	1
	there are a few limited options to sort the list of books.	1
	since i am going to have a lot of my own documents it is not going to work well.	1
	i think some way to organize books by folders is badly needed.	1
	3) support i don't think the support staff are all well trained.	1
	i also have a problem with the web browser.	1
	my dx came pre-registered.	1
	i think it is a nice touch by amazon.	1
	but for some reason the setup broke the web browser.	1
	i counldn't connect to the internet and i couldn't figure out how to fix it.	1
	it took two calls to support to get it resolved.	1
	the trick is to revert to factory default settings.	1
	the second support person then have to help me restore all my settings through the wireless connection.	1
	it was pretty painless process.	1
	but the first support person i contacted didn't seen to be aware of the process.	1
	there is also no excuse why my dx is pre-configured incorrectly  4) ui i am pretty good with gadgets.	1
	i own lots of them.	1
	i also have years of experiences with gui design.	1
	i found the gui inconsistent and difficult to use at times.	1
	a gui design always offers way for user to discover he features.	1
	this is not always the case with kindle.	1
	some features have to be turned on with combination of key strokes that are non intuitive.	1
	typing numbers with the alt key is also awful.	1
	i'll keep the dx.	1
	it has indeed helped me to solve a problem adequately.	1
	but it is an imperfect device that leave me wanting.       	1
	you have to understand the intentions of the product.i have had my kindle dx for 4 days now and i am love with it.	1
	it takes care of my technical documents superbly and not to mention the reading experience is unbelievable.	1
	the only legitimate complains one can possible see with the kindle are the badly-designed keyboard and lack of advanced functionality with pdf's.	1
	but beyond that, i will just have to assume you didn't do enough research before you bought the product.	1
	it is perfect for an undergraduate student like myself who wants to read papers as well as read books.	1
	maybe amazon will come up with a firmware update to help with the pdf capabilities.	1
	but i just find that a lot of the reviews are just by people who have been fans of kindle 1 and kindle 2, who bought this and found it to be dissapointing.	1
	guys, that's the point, it's not kindle 1, or kindle 2, it has different purposes.       	1
	lovely reader!.i recieved my kindle in anticipation of a several month trip where my acess to storage would be very limited (two small bags).	1
	i assumed it would never replace actual books, and have ultimatly decided it won't, but it was a close contest when i first recieved it.	1
	it is highly usable and purchasing books couldn't be easier.	1
	reading is not strenous on the eyes at all, my primary concern when first considering purchasing it.	1
	i do have one complaint, which i believe is not amazon's fault, but rather the publishers.	1
	many of the books i've purchased contain numerous minor typos.	1
	it may be a function of converting the text; regardless it proves to be irritating.	1
	i'm sure it will be worked out in the future.       	1
	as good as it gets.	1
	amazon has to drop the price now....i was thinking about buying a kindle dx but i wanted to wait until the ipad announcement.	1
	with the ipad at $499, amazon can't seriously keep the kindle dx at $489 can they?	1
	they'll have to lower the price to compete, i'm thinking in the $300 range.	1
	at that price, i think the dx would be competitive with the ipad.	1
	otherwise, it's a no-brainer...      	1
	how do i love thee?.	1
	it has just enough i need..	1
	macular degeneration delight.	1
	my kindle.	1
	the pdf support needs major fixing.no table of contents supportno annotations (even on page level)no highlightingno zoombookmarks cannot be renamed ('page 34' is not a helpful bookmark!	1
	)no folder support (for organizing pdfs)go to page accepts letters by default instead of numbers please fix these very annoying issues in a new firmware.	1
	pdf support really spoils an otherwise marvelous product.	1
	love it!.i really love my new kindle.	1
	i use it to read the new york times on the subway every day and i just finished my first novel on it.	1
	i no longer walk around feeling like a bag lady with half a week's newspaper in my bag.	1
	i have no fear of running out of things to read on the train.	1
	the paper uploads automatically every day and i charge it every 4 days or so.	1
	the novel downloaded in a few seconds.	1
	the screen is very easy to read and is non-glare.	1
	i really like the larger format too, as it seems closer to reading the paper.	1
	the downside is that i don't get to see the beautiful color pictures in the times and i may miss some articles that are in the print version, but i don't have time to sit side by side and compare with what's missing.	1
	i also have a lot less clutter around my house now that i am only getting the weekend papers delivered.	1
	i can't recommend this product enough, especially if you travel or commute by train.	1
	i would give this five stars but i do think its really expensive.	1
	it was a splurge and a real treat.	1
	i don't regret buying it for a moment.      	1
	kindle dx type clearer for me.my husband has the second generation kindle but with my vision i found the type just was not clear enough to enjoy it.	1
	and, making it larger  put fewer words per line and still not clear so my comprehension suffered.	1
	ran over and saw a friends new dx and ordered mine which i now love.	1
	i wish it was as light as the other because it is heavy enough that i don't always want to drag it around with me in my purse on a day to day basis.	1
	reading it at home or for travel is great though, i even like the larger book like size.      	1
	great new kindle!.	1
	kindle dx review.the size and clarity of the screen is, in my opinion, the finest quality.	1
	the home, back and menu keys are each well designed and easy to master.	1
	i like the placement of the power swutch and the method for turning on/off the wireless.	1
	i find the next page more difficult to use than in earlier models.	1
	the weight of the device makes it difficult to hold with one hand.	1
	nice!	1
	the right size.	1
	extremely useful for work..i bought this kindle on pre-order, also ordered the cover.	1
	i've found it extremely useful for work, as i've been able now to pack most of my reference materials on it.	1
	i deal a lot with cfr's (code of federal regulations), and to be able to stuff those heavy volumes into this lightweight companion represents a real plus in my book.	1
	pardon the pun.it has the ability to read .pdf files natively, which is an awesome step forward for the product.	1
	however, this functionality needs to be expanded upon: needs the ability to zoom into text within the .pdf pages in order to read some of the small print documents.	1
	there, of course is a more noticeable lag while turning pages in .pdf format, but it's tolerable.	1
	whispernet is the wireless part of the kindle's function for purchasing, subscribing and browsing that comes with the product.	1
	it's a good thing to see that finally you can see the final price at the same time you buy the product.	1
	and that's a change from anything else out there that involves services from a cellular service provider!      	1
	the only way to go if you read books with illustrations.	1
	kindle dx - a different kind of kindle.this is a copy of the review of kindle dx that i've posted at my blog (http://blogkindle.com) .	1
	you can read full version complete with pictures and much more there.	1
	exterior & ergonomics kindle dx is much larger and slightly heavier than kindle 2. in fact if you put k2 on top of dx, k2 would be almost the same size as dx's screen.	1
	it's still comfortable to hold and flip pages, at least for right handed people like me.	1
	of course it works upside down and it's usable this way but i will pass on making a judgment on how comfortable such setup would be for left-handed people.	1
	one thing for sure - alphanumeric keyboard is not usable this way.	1
	landscape mode is comfortable.	1
	as kindle is rotated, 5-way controller is automatically remapped so left remains left and right remains right.	1
	amazon leather cover now comes with two magnets to keep itself shut.	1
	if you are still using floppy disks from the previous millennium you shouldn't put them next to kindle dx if you are using the cover.kindle dx vs. kindle 2 kindle dx vs. kindle 2screen and fonts it's large.	1
	that's for sure.	1
	8241200 pixels.	1
	it seems to update faster than kindle 2 and whiles seems to be slightly lighter.	1
	there's minimal ghosting sometimes just as on my second k2.	1
	the first k2 that was bricked by airplane didn't have ghosting problem.	1
	screensaver pictures seem to be the same as in k2 but upscaled and they do look gorgeous on the big screen.	1
	fonts seem darker.	1
	so looks like amazon took complaints about low contrast in kindle 2 seriously and decided to address them.	1
	spatial resolution is slightly lower - 150ppi comared to 167 in kindle 2. i've downloaded samples of some of the 'books that look good on kindle dx's large screen'... really they should be called 'books that would have looked great on kindle dx should have looked great on kindle dx if images were not downsampled to lower resolution... i've checked 3 books and none looked as good as screensaver images.	1
	you could clearly see that illustrations in these books are much lower resolution than the screen.	1
	hopefully this will get fixed as some point.	1
	there are 7 font sizes just as in previous models.	1
	however the smallest font on kindle dx seems to correspond to second smallest on k2.	1
	i can't say for sure because i have droid fonts installed on my k2 so that i can read cyrillic.	1
	when font size dialog is invoked there are 2 additional options there that are specific to dx: 'words per line' and 'screen rotation'.	1
	the second one is pretty much self-explanatory: you can explicitly select one of the four rotations or set it auto and let the accelerometer control it.	1
	'words per line' really controls left and right margin width.	1
	three available options are: default, fewer and fewest.	1
	at the moment i don't quite understand the use of it.	1
	if i would want smaller screen area i'd just use k2.	1
	as this option is changed inline pictures as downscaled as well.screen rotation works as advertised - the image rotates as you rotated the device.	1
	refresh time is good.	1
	changing scren orientation is as fast as flipping a page.kindle dx landscape kindle dx landscapekeyboard keyboard layout is qwerty.	1
	numeric row is merged with top letter row.	1
	to enter numbers you need to hold the 'alt' button.	1
	if you just need to enter one digit, you can press 'alt' and digit in sequence ('alt' is 'sticky' just likethe 'shift' button).	1
	on dx buttons stick out more and are harder to press.	1
	overall i found k2 keyboard more comfortable and easy to use than dx.	1
	except 'next page' button being larger on dx, buttons on the right edge of the device are identical.	1
	5-way controller stick is higher on dx.pdf support kindle dx relies on it's large screen to display pdf files 'as is', without re-flowing the text (which would be next to impossible with pdf since the format lacks any concept of paragraphs or text continuity).	1
	the only way to zoom that i could find is to switch to landscape mode.	1
	it's not such a big problem because most pdf files that people would want to read are preformatted for either letter or a4 page size and kindle dx screen is comparable in size to these formats.	1
	although there is concept of pages in pdf and you can navigate to any given page, both internal and external links in pdf files are disabled.	1
	structured table of contents that is present in some pdf files is not usable either.	1
	graphically pdf files look fine and crisp.	1
	rendering time is also good.	1
	it usually takes around 5 seconds to open the file initially and after that pagination speed is the same as when reading ebooks.	1
	it's not possible to download pdf files to your kindle via whispernet.	1
	most likely this is because amazon pays 12 cents per megabyte to sprint while keeping internet connection free for kindle owners.	1
	given decent support that kindle dx has for pdf files, abundance of pdf files on the internet that people would like to download and read and relatively large size of these files it wouldn't be a good idea for amazon to enable such downloads.	1
	it so happens that in my past life i spent a lot of time writing software that would process pdf files.	1
	some time later i'll run a comprehensive test of pdf support in kindle dx and publish the results here.basic web web browsing seems to be that same as on kindle 2.	1
	'advanced mode' is now called 'desktop mode''.	1
	basic mode is still much faster and usable than desktop mode.	1
	i tried to render blogkindle.com in desktop mode and dx actually rendered it quite well.	1
	the only problem i could see was the lack of png transparency support.kindle dx basic web kindle dx basic web 9 inch screen definitely makes browsing a better experience.text-to-speech there are seemingly no changes in this feature.	1
	funny thing that i've noticed as i experimented with it that female voice seems to have trouble pronouncing word usb.	1
	with male voice turned on is sounds much more natural.hacking unfortunately kindle dx was unresponsive  to the 'old way hacking'.	1
	when i created a small 'update' using igor's tool to dump the system log along with full directory listing to the root of kindle drive the 'update your kindle' menu item remained disabled.	1
	either amazon has changed the format of the update files or they've come up with some way to digitally sign them to prevent hacking.	1
	either way this means no unicode fonts for kindle dx for the time being :(easter eggs i did a quick check on kindle 2 easter eggs.	1
	* minesweeper is still there.	1
	it's accessible by pressing alt-shift-m in the home screen.	1
	if you press g after minesweeper is started you can play gomoku (it's like tic-tac-toe but on a large board and the goal is to get 5 in a row).	1
	kindle is actually a very good gomoku player.	1
	i played it twice and so far the score is 1-1 even though human player always gets the first turn.	1
	* picture viewer is also there.	1
	to activate it connect kindle via usb cable to your pc and create 'pictures' folder in kindle usb disk.	1
	create subfolders there and copy pictures.	1
	subfolders will become 'book' names and pictures will be pages.	1
	jpg, png and gif files are known to be supported.	1
	once you've copied the files, disconnect the usb cable and press alt-z in the home screen - you should see your picture folders among books now.	1
	scaling options have moved from the main menu to font-size dialog.	1
	kindle dx will never try to stretch image to fit the screen but it can downscale to either fit width, height or screen.	1
	you can also display image at actual size and use 5-way controller to navigate the image.	1
	screen rotation is also supported.	1
	* symbol keyboard shortcuts are gone since numeric row is merged with the top letter row.	1
	* hidden settings are still there.	1
	typing '411 and '611 (using the alt-key) open corresponding settings pages.	1
	conclusions kindle dx is a nice device.	1
	perhaps it's not as much better as people hoped it would be but kindle 2 sets the bar quite high.	1
	for day-to-day book reading i would still recommend kindle 2 because of greater portability.	1
	if you can't get by without pdf support and don't want to use savory hack (that would add similar or better level support than what's available in 2.1) - kindle dx is right for you.	1
	hopefully with time there will be digital media that would take advantage of kindle dx's large screen.      	1
	nice device - but not if you have many books!.i bought the kindle dx because my sony prs-505 reader was too small for me - i needed a bigger screen for magazines and comics.	1
	also, the pdf functionality was something that sounded really good.	1
	i have now used the kindle dx for approximately 2 weeks, at home and on the road.	1
	i think it is a very nice device overall but if you have more than a handful of books or files you want to carry, it really lets you down.	1
	the good- quick delivery and painless order process (i live in germany so i ordered the international version)- very nice screen - just as good as my sony prs-505 which is considered one of the best e-ink screens- very good ergonomics - it is just right for long reading and the layout of the device is spot on- i find it very agreeable in terms of weight and size, even for prolonged reading sessions- very good fit and finish - it seems very solid and reliable, not cheap and creaky at all!- i have a few subscriptions on the device, that works without a problem and is a very nice experience overall- buying books works very well and is fast- text-to-speech works brilliantly with your own, unencrypted mobi files - that was a nice surprise!	1
	tts in general is pretty good.	1
	the bad- battery runtime - 2 weeks?that must be a joke!	1
	my experience was 2 days maximum and that is with wireless off!	1
	actually, this was pretty disappointing, especially coming from a sony prs-505 which runs for weeks on one charge.	1
	also, i found out that the sleep mode (the one where it shows the screensaver pictures) drains battery quite quickly - after 2 hours in sleep mode my battery went down to 85% from 100%.	1
	so, always turn off the screen ... - the amazon kindle dx cover - actually, this is not included so i bought it for 49$ - this cover was warped at one corner and the smell is horrible, even though it fades after a few days.	1
	i have not been able to get rid of the warped corner though so i think mine was defective.	1
	i have invested in a leather sleeve now and that is much nicer overall.	1
	the ugly- performance is really, really bad.	1
	and i mean bad as in 'want to throw the thing out of the window'.	1
	i have about 1250 books on my kindle right now as well as about 25 pdf files and several subscriptions.	1
	if you want to carry your library on your kindle and fill up the 3.3 gigs it offers, you better forget that because it seems the more you put on it the slower it gets.	1
	my books are converted mobi files so they are text only and not heavyweight pdf files.	1
	even filtering the home screen (going from 'all items' to 'subscriptions' for example takes about 3 to 5 minutes each time.	1
	searching is impossible, if you start a search it can take about 45 minutes until the device becomes responsive again.	1
	since you cannot cancel an operation, that means resetting the device if you are fed up with waiting - if you are actually able to do that, because even the off switch does not work anymore when the device is busy!	1
	performance when reading a book is generally ok but for some reason the device will lock up occasionally when you try to go to the next page - it doesn't react and it also does not show the spinning donut - it just freezes.	1
	after 45 to 60 seconds it goes to the next page but of course you are completely thrown out of any reading mood.	1
	also, the fact that there is no way of organizing your content on the device becomes very annoying when you have more than a handful of documents.	1
	the search is useless (see above) so you will be paging a lot on the home screen to find a specific book.	1
	i currently have about 90 pages on my homescreen - so you can imagine what this means when jumping between documents.	1
	so here is my wrap-up: nice device, great finish and build quality, great screen and the ergonomics are very good (if you discount the terrible amazon cover).	1
	the ecosystem, the store and the subscriptions are very nice as well and work very well.	1
	however, battery runtime and performance are really sub-par, especially in light of what amazon promises on their site.	1
	if you regularly carry a lot of books or documents, you will be disappointed.	1
	it is ok for a handful of books but not more.	1
	also, i find it shady of amazon to promise 'up to 3500 books' given the fact that the software actually does not really support it very well.	1
	i would not buy it again but i will not send it back either.	1
	for what it offers, it is definitively too expensive but there is no competition out there right now with a similar screen size - maybe the ipad will change that.	1
	in any case, amazon would do well to improve the software quickly!      	1
	kindle dx international version - top 12 reasons to buy.i carefully weighed the pros and cons between several e-readers, including the ipad, before deciding to purchase a kindle dx.	1
	read the kindle blogs and you will get a lot of useful information.pros:1.  no monthly charges for kindle dx wireless (unlike the ipad which is only free to download if you have separate connectivity, like a wireless home network)2.  easy to surf internet, e-mail, download, and read books on kindle dx (did i say, with no additional monthly charge)3.  large screen, hardcover size, is perfect for me (my oldest son prefers an ipod touch-sized screen)4.  easy on eyes.	1
	the e-ink reviews were generally favorable....and i was not disappointed, the kindle dx is very easy to read even in low light5.	1
	16 grayscale draws beautifully, despite not being color, and it is easy to change between 6 different font sizes6.	1
	ease of use when navigating - the functionality of the menu, the back key, paging forward or backward, jumping to a page - is well designed7.	1
	ability to move the cursor to a word and read the definition at the bottom of the page is very useful, then click 'enter' to get a full page definition!8.	1
	ability to create your own notes and attach them to a sentence, creates a superscript note number, very easy to do....9.  download book samples from amazon (usually 10-20 pages, length varies) makes it very easy to read before you buy, and make better selections10.	1
	ability to copy pdf files from my pc onto the kindle (e.g.	1
	for computer manuals, works great)11.  long battery life - 1 to 2 weeks at a time, and battery can be recharged anytime without fear of losing battery life12.	1
	search functionality is well designed.	1
	paragraphs containing the search phrase can be displayed so you see the word/phrase in context and can jump there easily'wish list' items:1.  folders/filing system to organize books (can only order by recent, title, and author) - seems like this could be done with improvements in the software and downloaded to current kindle owners2.	1
	separate numeric keypad (using the alt key every time you type a digit is annoying)3.  sd card slot for additional memory (could use additional memory for music, photos, etc...and the native 3.3 gb memory for books)4.  more apps...a couple of included games are fun, but the kindle dx is capable of many more applications      	1
	readings a pleasure - again!.	1
	the kindle is a real tecnology gift.	1
	a great device.i purchased the kindle dx last week.	1
	i agree that it is pricey but in the two days that i have had it, the kindle has exceeded my expectations.	1
	the type is sharp and easy to read.	1
	i live in a marginal wireless coverage area, so my downloads take a little longer but the wait is worth it.	1
	i highly recommend the kindle dx.       	1
	awesome!!!!!!!	1
	!.love it!!!	1
	i have been researching ereaders for quite some time, including all brands.	1
	if i was going to invest that much money on something i wanted to make sure i got the most for my money.	1
	more importantly i needed something that would function well for me.	1
	i have an eye disease that is causeing a loss of vision in my left eye rapidly, which makes it difficult for me to sit and read.	1
	i love to read and can only read 3 to 4 pages at a time without causing my eyes to hurt badly.	1
	i just recieved my kindledx yesterday, which was early compared to what they originally told me the shipping date would be.	1
	i read all the directions that show up directly on the kindle itself which appears on screen and allows you not to have to carry a manuel around with you to answer any questions you may have.	1
	i set the font size comfortable for me and set fewer words per page and i was able to read almost a whole book in one night!	1
	the only potiental problem i see is that there is no way to organize your books.	1
	they show up in order and when you turn it on after it being turned off it automatically starts on the last page you read, but i cant figure out how to organize the books themselves.	1
	otherwise i am very happy with my purchase and it was well worth the money for me.	1
	i can now read more often and more at one time like i used to with severe eye pain!!!!!!	1
	well worth the cost.      	1
	love it..i really enjoy my kindle dx.	1
	it is large enough to get illustrations of the page even with large type selected.	1
	the large type and large format enables me to read more often such as in a moving train or bus.	1
	it is better than a book or newspaper because one can select the font size that is comfortable.	1
	the high contrast of the type adds to readability.	1
	i subscribe to three daily papers now and buy my books for the kindle.	1
	i take it just about everywhere.	1
	the only irritation is the on-off-standby switch; my fingers slip on the switch placing the kindle in standby instead turning off.	1
	sometimes the kindle gets confused in this process and reboots.	1
	i wish they would put a better switch on it, but this minor.	1
	i use the kindle a lot.	1
	i am glad i got the larger format kindle with the leather case.      	1
	love love love my dx!.the bigger screen absolutely puts it over the top for me, and the graphics are quite nice.	1
	i do agree that having the buttons on one side is a bit awkward, but it's just not enough to detract from the pluses, to my way of thinking.	1
	seriously, that big screen is just awesome.        	1
	best christmas present.	1
	well worth the price, it made the best christmas present ever!	1
	!.	1
	none.	1
	amazing.	1
	the best.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	love my kindle!!	1
	!.this product is wonderful!	1
	i love the fact that i can now carry my library with me and the books are more reasonably priced!      	1
	kindle review.	1
	couldn't love it more.	1
	good investment.	1
	wow.	1
	love it but....i love the price of books and the instant download speed.	1
	i do not like that i can't read it in the dark.	1
	i was hoping it would be backlit by now and it is a bit heavy if you are holding it up for a period of time.	1
	i think it is amazing to have a stack of books, magazines and newspaper in one device.	1
	great for travel. 	1
	kindle dx.	1

	love my new kindle dx.i received my kindle dx as a gift and could not be happier!	1
	i am very pleased with the user friendly software and the ease with which i can find and purchase books.	1
	love the larger screen and the ability to change the layout.	1
	the combination power and usb cable is innovative and very well made.	1
	i love the ability to download documents and .jpeg files from my laptop.	1
	i am looking forward to many happy hours of use.	1

	6 full bookcases gone.	1
	enjoyment.my wife and i have been using the kindle dx for five months.	1
	we both enjoy them immensely.	1
	we have been avid readers all our lives but now read more than ever.	1
	we were not sure we would enjoy the e-book format but find it to be just fine.	1
	i hope in time you can get better contrast and brightness control.	1
	thanks for all the efforts.	1
	keep up this excellent revolution.      	1
	my awesome library.	1
	easy reading.	1
	hold a library in your hand.	1
	(with thanks to a&p;:) first off, let me say that the 'four stars' i've given to the dx is not indicative of my personal enthusiasm for the device.	1
	i am absolutely thrilled with my kindle (a gift), and am as distracted as a one-eyed dog in a sausage factory with all the possibilities for texts that i can inexpensively load up into it.	1
	there are some minor technical and convenience issues that will ideally be addressed in later versions, hence the only four stars.	1
	but in the meantime, i can scarcely contain my pleasure for my kindle!	1
	i am likely not amazon's ideal kindle target.	1
	my interests are philosophy, logic, and classical literature and poetry.	1
	this means that, with the exception of the logic, everything i am most interested in is out of copyright and thus easily available for little or no money, while on the other hand my memberships in professional associations ensures that i have free access to huge volumes of technical literature.	1
	pdf versions of these texts (except for the logic) are readily available from the internet archive (http://www.archive.org/index.php), while the logic texts are either freely published on the web or (given my memberships) downloadable from sites like jstor.	1
	this being the case, the thing about the kindle dx that caught my eye was its native ability to display .pdf files.	1
	within the limits of my experience, i have been enormously happy with this piece of the kindle's functionality.	1
	other commentors have noted that the display of 'double column' .pdf texts, such as is found in some journal articles, is small and sometimes difficult to read.	1
	i have not encountered this problem.	1
	the one piece of double-columned fine print i've looked at was from a complete shakespeare edition downloaded from the internet archive.	1
	even with a full page displayed i found the text perfectly readable, and my eye-sight is not in any way exceptional (likely i'll be moving to trifocals with my next eye exam).	1
	also, the formal and mathematical symbolism from my technical journals and downloads have all displayed without problem.	1
	the only difficulty i have encountered with a .pdf file was from the above mentioned complete shakespeare, and i encountered this in several different files: for no reason obvious to me, the table of contents did not display.	1
	go figure.	1
	which brings me to a totally unexpected discovery: there are an enormous number of free or really cheap ($1.00) native kindle books and collections available at amazon and elsewhere.	1
	for $1.00 you can download the complete works of shakespeare from amazon with an active table of contents that will not only take you directly to every play or poem, but with the plays it will even take you to each individual act.	1
	these native kindle files are smaller than their .pdf equivalents by upwards of two orders of magnitude, which means you can save more of them in your kindle library.	1
	the advantage of scanned .pdf's is that they have a fixed page structure should you wish to refer to that information.	1
	on the other hand, native kindle texts allow you to make your own annotations.	1
	(however, make sure that the kindle text you get has an 'active table of contents.')	1
	technical issues that leave the kindle still wanting that fifth star: there are only a minimal number of ways that you can sort your kindle titles, and there is nothing like a 'subdirectory structure' in which to store materials.	1
	this problem can be partially mitigated with .pdf files by employing careful naming conventions.	1
	for example, my .pdf's relating to american philosophy all begin with the name 'amphil ]]' followed by the author then the title of the book.	1
	so john dewey's 'how we think' is 'amphil ]] dewey - how we think', etc.	1
	kindle will sort by title (which can be controlled with .pdf's), author (which is usually missing with .pdf's) and most recent.	1
	so given the large volume of .pdf files i have, the above is relatively serviceable.	1
	however, with native kindle files, this method will not work.	1
	in this instance, the device will ignore file names and look directly at book or collection titles.	1
	you will typically have the author sort option available, but things will still get a tad arbitrary in their sorting.	1
	so a feature that would be nice would be sortable user-defined tags that would permit the user to collect books into themes (and, ideally sub-themes), then author for better organization.	1
	another desirable upgrade would be the ability to increase display size of .pdf files.	1
	while this has not been a problem for me (yet) i can still see how others might find this especially helpful.	1
	some folks have complained about the weight, but this has not been an issue for me: the books i read tend to be significantly heavier than the kindle itself.	1
	recall, for example, the above mentioned complete works of shakespeare ... still, despite these limitations, i could hardly be any more pleased with my dx than i already am.	1
	i've always been the type of person who had 3 -- 5 books on my stand at any given time, so having an entire library in my hand simply beggars my imagination.	1
	the kindle automatically remembers where you last left-off with whatever book you were reading, so moving amongst multiple texts is an easy matter.	1
	and with so much classical, out-of-copyright material available, the kindle invites you to luxuriate in masterpieces.	1
	(i am an educated man, but i had no idea that i actually liked 'moby dick' until the $1.00 possibility of 10 melville novels in one volume made it an option i couldn't refuse.)	1
	so while there are technical issues to be aware of, my final word on the kindle dx is that i highly praise this device, and recommend it without qualification to anyone who loves to read.	1
	(by the bye, the  makes for an excellent kindle carrier, and is less expensive than the purpose built, kindle bags that i have seen.)	1
	kindle not ready for older users.	1
	ilove my kindle dx!!	1
	!.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	serenity in reading!.	1
	i love my kindle!.	1
	kindle delivers.i am an avid reader and kindle has made the reading and procuring of great books a snap.	1
	the ease and operation of kindle is supreme.	1
	i am most impressed with how unlike my computer this is so easy on the eyes.	1
	spent week in mexico and reading on beach was great and having 8 books with me in one slim neat package was cool.	1
	i am browsing all kinds of books now and am amazed at all amazon has to offer and so many free or under $7.00.	1
	love me some kindle!	1
	david futrell      	1
	an impressive step in an valuable direction.i like e-nature of the e-reader.	1
	the resolution & 'readability' is quite good -- & i can now easily carry around tons of periodicals & books -- that otherwise would be wholly impractical (&, certainly, undesirable).	1
	it seems that books are the most 'natural' & best forum for the (present) e-reader.	1
	i think that where the kindle needs improvement / evolution is (primarily) with respect to periodicals (magazines, newspapers & the like):  [most of these points also apply to books, but to a lesser degree of impact / importance.]	1
	moreover, these are my views & opinions which may or may not be shared by other users.	1
	(1) illustrative pictures, diagrams & the like are mostly missing -- & are never placed in context with the text.	1
	these things can be key to improved reading & comprehension of the text.	1
	even ads -- arrayed around & interspersed among the pages add useful & often desirable content & information.	1
	(2) navigation on the kindle is not just 'poor' -- it is bad!	1
	we have learned to scan newspapers & magazines quickly to select & jump around to what is available & what we want to scan / read.	1
	this is not possible with the present generation of kindles.	1
	we rarely have the time or luxury to read 'everything'.	1
	while the kindle has a 'menu' to 'navigate' between articles & sections, imo, the present kindle's navigation is a poor and hard-to-use 'shell' -- when compared with scanning magazine or newspapers -- via their layout, indexes (with summaries), ability to easily flip through pages, etc.	1
	imo, all this is much better and quite well handled by the zinio (magazine) reader format (which i like a lot).	1
	(3) the select & forward &lt;--> back key / button is not very easy to use or 'user friendly'.	1
	[personally, i think it is awkward to use & poorly done.]	1
	(4) the kindle needs to be(come) a browser -- complete with lots of links -- so that one can readily (quickly, easily & facilely) read -- research & review -- lots of stuff on the web.	1
	(5) the kindle needs to have the ability to have & add links (to the web, other sections, user summaries & notes, & other materials) within the text or 'anywhere'.	1
	(6) the 'keyboard' on the present rendition of the kindle is useless & effectively does nothing that i couldn't do without.	1
	however, as is obvious from my comments, when links, notes, browser & other functions are eventually added to the kindle, the presence of a really good & user-friendly keyboard becomes vital.	1
	(7) i don't like to have my periodicals 'disappear' when the new version(s) come out.	1
	when i buy a periodical (in physical format), i own the product & can file, pile, read & re-read, give away the issues at my will.	1
	i feel like amazon is 'stealing' from me when the back-issues are 'taken back'.      	1
	love it!.i spent a considerable amount of time researching this product as i knew i would not be happy with the original sized version.	1
	i even found books that weighed what the kindle dx weighed, and to my surprise, the dx was more compact and lighter than i had anticipated.	1
	i am an avid reader and am now in the process of rotating my reading material with the kindle and the books i own.	1
	the kindle is a pleasure.	1
	i also purchased their waterproof cover as i own a pool and have taken this on vacation.	1
	in addition, i purchased the mighty bright light which is the best book light i have ever owned.	1
	i keep my kindle in the waterproof jacket all the time, so there is no issue with the light slipping.	1
	i also purchased a red case for it as i read the leather case was crappy from other reviewers.	1
	it is a tight fit for the kindle in the case with the waterproof case on it, but the red case holds the charger.	1
	i am extremely pleased with these items.      	1
	only one complaint.i had the kindle 2 and was enjoying it immensely when my husband surprised me with the kindle dx.	1
	i do enjoy the extra reading space, but my only complaint is that they only have a 'next page' on one side.	1
	i really would have enjoyed it on both sides as in the kindle 2.  i know it seems like a small thing, but when you've had it already, it's hard to get used to having it only on one side.	1
	besides that, i truly enjoy the kindle dx and all the possibilities it has.      	1
	i love this kindle.i love this kindle dx, the product is easy to use, easy to hold.	1
	i have arthritis in my hands and i thought i might have problems, but haven't so far.	1
	the printing is bold, just thought it could have used a backlight on it.	1
	very simple to buy books for it, just one click and you have it.	1
	the only problem i have is this; i was under the impression i could share my books with a friend, who also has one.	1
	we can't do that, so may not buy that many books off  it.	1
	we always trade books and now can't do that, she would have to buy it herself.	1
	in these tough times, am having second thoughts about it.	1
	my niece is considering buying one and i will have to tell her about this problem.      	1
	kindle dx.i have througly enjoyed my dx.	1
	the download of new books is extremely easy and flawless.	1
	the abiliity to change from landscape to portrait views allows me the option on how to view the page that i'm reading.	1
	the ability to review new books on the dx without using the computer amazon website has increased my use.       	1
	love my kindle.i absolutely love my kindle dx.	1
	i have a friend who ordered the 2nd generation kindle and, after seeing it, i know i would have been ok with that purchase as well.	1
	but, the fact that you can use the dx in any orientation (portrait or landscape) along with the larger screen is a big plus.	1
	i love to read and wondered if i'd miss the feel of a book and the answer is no.	1
	the only criticism is that there is no way to organize my books.	1
	i'd like to be able to create folders and keep my authors organized that way.	1
	not a problem now because i don't have all that many titles but in a year it could be cumbersome.	1
	but, on the whole - a+	1
	great functionality - weak construction.	1
	crack on my kindle dx.sorry, but i love the kindle dx, however, mine has a crack top left where the kindle leather cover inserts into it.	1
	as it was immediate or it came that way and i didn't notice right off, but i was told that was not covered and i am very disappointed because i'm sure i received a flawed kindle dx.	1
	it does happen!      	1
	not for everyone, but for some...awesome.	1
	at this price point, this device is clearly not for everyone.	1
	however, as an avid reader with a large ebook collection (gotta love russian and chinese sites), the kindle dx is a dream come true for me.	1
	is it perfect?	1
	no.	1
	is it the best available right now?	1
	absolutely.	1
	it will only get better and better from here on out, but i would have no problem recommending the dx to others like myself.	1
	you will not regret buying one.       	1
	wonderful device!.	1
	i was so very happy when this birthday gift from my fiancee arrived.	1
	i love how easy it is to put my own pdf content onto the kindle dx, and how beautiful these pdf's looked.	1
	i have not had to rotate the screen into landscape mode once (i have played with it of course but never found the need to.)	1
	the whisper net service is amazing and free!	1
	checking [...] used to be the most surfed website on my ipod touch.	1
	with the kindle however i pay $1.99 per blog and have it delivered to my kindle anywhere there is 3g!	1
	being a news hound this feature is worth the price of the device itself!	1
	i am especially enjoying the prospect of not having to lug around a backpack full of science texts.	1
	most of the textbooks i am going to use next semester are available from amazon for the kindle, and they are even cheaper than paper versions.	1
	i will have to get back to you all regarding how useful the dx is in that regard as i take full advantage of the margins in my text books, and it may be difficult weening myself off of that practice.	1
	overall i have been very impressed.	1
	the only negative thing i might say about the dx (mind you i think the benefits far out weigh the negative) is that it does weigh a bit.	1
	sure i can hold the dx with one hand, but after awhile it does get a little heavy.	1
	no heavier really than a normal hardback book, but still a little heavy.	1
	i find myself reading quite a bit more and therefore seem to notice the heft more frequently.	1
	i do not remember noticing this effect when dealing with fiction hardbacks, but then again i was probably expecting the weight.	1
	take care all, and i hope this review was helpful.	1
	gerald rude      	1
	great experience...plus question 11-20-09.	1
	amazon stumbles.	1
	potential future market, especially among those living abroad..a couple friends at my church got me the kindle dx as a gift.	1
	it's a wonderful product and here are my thoughts on it.	1
	great points1) fast way to get the newest and out of prints books.	1
	working abroad in korea, it takes weeks for me to order a book from the states.	1
	so being able to just purchase it on amazon and transfer it to my kindle is huge.	1
	2) clear text like reading off of paper.the clarity of the text is truly amazing.	1
	i tried reading books on my ipod touch and the black text on the white background hurts my eyes after awhile.	1
	not so with the kindle.	1
	3) nice, thin, and portable.the dx is beautiful, thin, and very portable.	1
	people look at it and immediately want one of their own because they just made this one look so nice!	1
	drawbacks:1) inconvenient keyboard.the keyboard on the dx is poorly designed and in order to use it, i have to lay the dx flat on the ground, use my feet to hold it from moving, and then my fingers to type.	1
	it would be nice if more innovation was put into the keyboard.	1
	it really is a useless feature as of now.	1
	2) super super slow.although the dx has many wonderful features, it must be noted that it is painfully slow!	1
	when you click the 'next page' button, it takes a good moment before it turns the page.	1
	every button you press, the dx responds super slow.	1
	this discourages me from searching for text, flipping through the book to a particular page i'm looking for, and switching between different books i've purchased.	1
	it makes the whole reading experience very 'linear'.	1
	i really hope this improves in future versions because it is painfully 1970s slow right now.	1
	i've heard rumors that apple may release a competitor for the kindle.	1
	i hope they do because that's the only way that these products are gonna get better.	1
	3) whisper net not available outside u.s.i am currently working in korea and i travel often.	1
	unfortunately, the whispernet wireless service for purchasing and receiving books is not available outside of the u.s.  it would've been nice if the dx has a wifi feature.	1
	but then again, the device is so slow i don't know if i want to use it for browsing or purchasing books.	1
	also, amazon did not include instructions on how to get purchased books unto the kindle.	1
	i had to figure it out on my own (hint: you have to copy the downloaded 'azw' file into the kindle's folder system).	1
	there were no help pages online that i could find.	1
	a bit unprofessional and inconsiderate of their customers as many americans travel often.	1
	all in all, i commend amazon for making such a beautiful breakthrough product.	1
	many other companies have tried to develop ebook readers but no one has been able to create a market for it like amazon has.      	1
	reading made more enjoyable.i bought this as a trial to see how well it would work for me since i have low vision and am legally blind as a result.	1
	i'm happy to report that the kindle dx has been a great help to me.	1
	i like that all my books can be turned into large print; however, i would like to see one-two more larger font sizes added in the future.	1
	the text to speech quality is pretty good but has trouble with the pronunciation of some words which should be improved but does not detract all that much.	1
	i did not find the larger format to be cumbersome.	1
	the larger screen makes this a necessary trade off and is easily solved by using a book stand or lap desk if reading for extended periods.	1
	i also enjoy receiving my favorite magazines and new newspaper automatically.	1
	i love the portability and ease with which i can carry a variety of reading materials.	1
	overall, i'm very pleased with my new kindle and have read 4 books since i got it a month ago!      	1
	happy and unhappy.a month has passed since a purchased the kindle dx, and i can not tell you how happy i was when i opened the box connected the device to my computer and started transferring my collection of computer books on pdf format thinking that this will help minimize the space an load on my backpack .	1
	once i opened the first book i noticed that pictures were missing and the book was auto scaling in order to fit the page on the screen, this made the book hard to read since the letters became very small this happened on 5 out of 9 books.	1
	right away i called tech support and explained step by step the problem i was having with the device, so to make the story short all i got was a bunch of sweet talk and not a straight answer.	1
	i was told by tech support to email the books to the free conversion services.	1
	hoping that this will save the day i emailed the books; five seconds after i received an automatic reply saying that the conversion for this book was not possible due to the book been already a pdf file.	1
	why i was not told by the tech support agent that this services was for word document format.	1
	well i made three more calls to tech support and i never got a straight answer (very vey very disappointed.....) this is the reason why i gave this device a 3 out of 5 stars, i will admit that it is easy to buy books and the delivery time is amazing but i wish they've tested the pdf feature a little longer so they can see that it was not fully functional.	1
	this actually reminds me the time when bill gates was performing a demonstration of plug and play on windows 95 with a usb scanner and once he plugged the device he got a blue screen of death.	1
	i have not plans on buying the computer books i already have on pdf format from the kindle store.	1
	so my last word to you kindle developers is to please release an update that fixes pdf books not showing pictures  in some of them and to correct the auto scaling features, oh and one more thing switching from portrait to landscape and vice versa takes way too long when reading pdf books.	1
	immersive reading for a high price.i am a computer programmer and i need to read a lot of technical documents at work, i also enjoy  reading newspapers and books at length  during leisure.	1
	i decided to buy the kindle dx and i like it a lot after using it for a week.	1
	i would recommend it to avid readers who can look past its price-tag.	1
	the things that most impressive about the kindle dx -- 1. great e-ink display - the e-ink display of kindle dx reads just like a book and with no backlighting - meaning no eyestrain.	1
	this allows for very fast reading for long durations.	1
	the dx screen size is perfect for reading technical books, newspapers in addition to novels.	1
	2. ability to 'uni-task' - unlike reading a newspaper on a laptop, kindle gets out of the way when you start reading.	1
	with no ads, email notifications or distractions of a regular computer makes for immersive reading experience.	1
	i wouldn't want more 'side-features' on the kindle which would distract from pure reading.	1
	3. great wireless delivery service from amazon - amazon allows you to sample books by reading the first chapters before you decide to buy, there are also 14-day trials available for newspapers and magazines, which i liked very much.	1
	4. decent native pdf support - pdf documents transferred through computer or amazon scale well.	1
	i could not find any loss in formatting or quality while reading pdfs but inability to zoom pdfs/personal documents which are not sized properly is somewhat of a handicap in addition to some loss of brightness when reading high-color pdfs.	1
	5. longish battery life - the battery life is good once you turn off the wireless, but it is far short of 2 weeks that amazon brags about.	1
	if you flip through pages a lot and have the wireless turned on, it loses power quickly.	1
	places where kindle dx falls short - 1. keyboard - the dx keyboard is lousy off the bat.	1
	the keys are too small and too close together to be used effectively.	1
	thankfully i don't plan to type much.	1
	2. weight and shape - i would have preferred a somewhat squarish shape with an 8' display instead of its oblong 9.7' form.	1
	it weighs quite a bit, especially with the cover and even a person with large hands would need to use two hands or on a surface to read at stretch.	1
	how do you justify its high price?	1
	personally, i think amazon and other ebook manufacturers are 2-3 years from delivering amature device at a reasonable cost.	1
	so if you do decide to buy now, you should be able to save on lower priced ebooks/newspapers in addition to saving shelf space and added portability. 	1
	finally, the diagnosis is right!	1
	kindle dx.i love to read, so i own lots of books.	1
	my wife would like to give away my books, as they take up too much room.	1
	the kindles have been a dream come true, that even my wife appreciates.	1
	the kindle dx is as perfect for me as can be.	1
	i imagine that my medical textbooks' images would even do well on it.	1
	i am a big guy and the kindles 1 and 2 were too small.	1
	i wanted this size of screen right from the beginning.	1
	i like the dx's simpler organization of the letter/number buttons and navigation buttons, but i am right handed.	1
	my kindle 1 screen broke on an airline flight, so i bought the leather (just ok) cover to protect the dx's screen.	1
	one handed reading is not feasible.	1
	the images are so much better on the dx.	1
	the processor speed is adequate.	1
	the toggle mechanism is way better than the kindle 1's wheel.	1
	reading in bed has reached new heights of ecstasy.	1
	the dx is definitely the cure for male frustration on nights when you hear 'i have a headache'.	1
	just take off to the kindle amazon bookstore in the comfort of your own bed, and spend her share of the money on more books.      	1
	great upgrade from first kindle.pros i find the new dx a great leap from the first kindle.	1
	the bigger screen allows for smoother reading, the graphics are awesome, and i like the weight and feel of it.	1
	the five way search button is great.	1
	i also like the set up of the dictionary it is more user friendly.	1
	cons  i do miss the ability to have a memory card but being able to download to my computer will work.	1
	one other concern is no buttons on the left, i am a rightie but i sleep on the left and well you know.	1
	i also did not appreciate having to buy the cover seperately.	1
	all in all i love it.      	1
	non expert enjoying dx.	1
	keeps getting better.this is the 3rd kindle i have purchased.	1
	going from kindle 1 to the dx shows the improvements that have been made.	1
	for me the dx is a great size.	1
	it is easier to read with the larger screen and more book-like in feel and look.	1
	i much prefer the buttons on this version.	1
	graphics are much easier to read and study.	1
	cost may be an issue but the savings on books will make up for it quickly.	1
	i am reading much more on the kindle than ever before.	1
	it is great to be able to read a review of a book and immediately download it.	1
	amazon has done a terrific job of listening to feedback and making improvements.       	1
	great...until.....	1
	great large-format reader, too few accessories.	1
	a dangerous vice!.	1
	i think it is worth it..	1
	kindle dx.	1
	expensive but totally cool!.i've owned my kindle dx for three days now, and though i don't normally write reviews when there are already so many, i wanted to add my voice concerning this innovative, fun, and useful gadget.	1
	i originally bought it for two reasons: subscribe to the newspaper without all the paper, and carry several books when traveling, without all the weight.	1
	pluses: when reading the newspaper, i do not get ink on my hands, i do not have to deal with all the paper, and no trees are being felled for my reading pleasure.	1
	i also do not have to struggle with the large format of the paper.	1
	though this also means i cannot see all the stories on a page at a glance, it's worth the trade-off.	1
	magazines are often printed on glossy paper, and i find that the older i get the harder it is to read from a glossy page.	1
	the kindle is much easier on my eyes, as long as i avoid having a direct light source directly behind me.	1
	also related to the age of my eyes, being able to choose the font size is a great boon.	1
	i've read books recently that were hard on my eyes due to small type.	1
	with the kindle, this is not a problem.	1
	i may just be lazy here, but the built-in dictionary and easy access to google and wikipedia are convenient.	1
	i don't have to get up and walk over to the dictionary or the computer to look up something i don't recognize.	1
	instant gratification is probably a character weakness, but it's nice to be able to get books instantly (well, in about 60 seconds or so).	1
	i am developing arthritis in my thumb, and holding a book open has become painful.	1
	but the kindle is flat and rigid, easy to hold in one hand or prop up.	1
	it doesn't flop over or flip shut like a book, or sag like a magazine or newspaper.	1
	compared to reading on the computer, the kindle allows me to sit comfortably in my easy chair, rather than slumped at the computer, and i find this much more relaxing.	1
	and the e-ink is easier on my eyes than the computer screen.	1
	now the minuses.	1
	there are three i can think of: placing the cursor on a word brings up a definition if it's in the dictionary, and a few clicks will take you to google or wikipedia for that word.	1
	but if you want to google a word that is not in the dictionary, you have to type it by hand on the tiny keyboard keys, which is awkward.	1
	they should have allowed the word at the cursor to be placed in the search box with just a hit on the return key.	1
	this is not a big deal, but it would have been so easy to implement.	1
	this is a bigger issue: there is no directory structure.	1
	a device capable of holding 3,500 books needs some way for them to be organized into subdirectories or subfolders, as on all computers nowadays.	1
	there is a search function to find items, but i anticipate difficulty locating items once there are a hundred or so items on the kindle.	1
	this also would be easy to rectify, and i regard it as a serious shortcoming that they did not address it.	1
	when you buy a book you can pass it along to someone else when you are done.	1
	to share a kindle book with a friend you'd have to loan her your kindle.	1
	maybe that's the biggest drawback of all.	1
	overall, i love this toy.	1
	it is very expensive, but if you have the money to spend, it is a great way to read newspapers, magazines, and books.	1
	i give it five stars.      	1
	surprises..i thought that whispernet was just a nice marketing idea.	1
	afterall, why not just download to the pc, then transfer.	1
	i'm using it a lot.	1
	you never know what you want to start reading, and a delay may just derail you.	1
	i am re-reading mark twain (all his works through mobi-book for like $5).	1
	i am using underlining and note-taking a lot because i love twain quotes.	1
	another surprise.	1
	pdf is very very very useful.	1
	i have huge pdf manuals, including the 1000 page u.s. navy diving manual uploaded.	1
	very easy to read and access.	1
	reason enough to buy the kindle dx.	1
	the only real negative is the weight.	1
	i am a big guy.	1
	i like holding my books with one hand.	1
	this is noticeably heavy for that, although i am getting used to it.	1
	i am reading much more because of this gizmo.	1
	i am about to buy 2 more for gifts, but i am behind the 8 ball because there is a 2 to 3 week backorder!	1
	get one.	1
	i only gave 4 stars because of the weight.	1
	i would have like to give 4 1/2 stars      	1
	new  kindle user:great speakers.i am a new kindle user and love it!	1
	i always want convenience and kindle is ultimate in that respect.	1
	i am left handed and have no qualms about the right handed orientation of the buttons.	1
	it simply is not an issue for me.	1
	the great surprising bonus for me is how good the speakers sound.	1
	i didnt even know it played music and when i loaded a few songs the speakers actually sounded very respectable.	1
	when i hooked up headphones it sounded great!	1
	my whole family loves it and i am enjoying the new york times which i could never afford before.	1
	con: so far only one complaint: i wish the background was whiter and less grey for a better contrast.       	1
	great for graduate students who work with pdfs.as a graduate student the addition of the pdf functionality on the dx is fantastic.	1
	i was able to transfer the 280+ technical papers (pdfs) related to my dissertation nearly instantly through the usb cord.	1
	now i am able to carry with me everything i need, a huge help when you are working on your dissertation.	1
	i've found even pdf pages with small type easy to read on the large dx screen, but if text size is an issue the ability to rotate the device to landscape view makes the text size nearly identical to a physical page of paper.	1
	the only features i think that are missing from making this a truly killer device is the ability to label bookmarks in pdfs (bookmarking with page number is supported), and add annotations to pdfs.	1
	i definitely highly recommend it!      	1
	the best kindle yet!.i have the two previous kindles, and the dx is the best yet.	1
	the screen is much larger than i expected, and i think that the photographs are much cleaner looking on the dx.	1
	i thought that the dx was faster when looking on the web, but the only site i went to was the amazon site.	1
	the screen is just incredible.	1
	i cannot wait for a color e-ink, but for now i am very happy with the kindle dx.	1
	if i had to choose between the three kindle's i would buy the dx.	1
	the price difference is worth the larger screen.	1
	the whole kindle 2 fits inside the screen of the dx.	1
	a nice change is no buttons on the left side so that you can hold the kindle without pushing buttons.	1
	i still think the kindle needs a place to hold for people with larger hands, but the dx is an improvement.	1
	i do wish they did not eliminate the numbers row of keys and place them with the top row of letters.	1
	the buttons look sleeker on the dx, but i like the feel of the buttons on the kindle 2 better.	1
	again, i have larger hands and the buttons are a bit awkward.	1
	if you are left-handed, you can flip the kindle upside down, and hold the kindle with your right hand without hitting buttons.	1
	a benefit of the screen adjusting to any way you chose to hold the kindle dx.	1
	the price is a bit high, but if you read a lot, it is worth it.	1
	it is completely different than reading on a computer; so much less eye strain.	1
	as an educator, i would love to see a student price so that students could afford them.	1
	as a doctoral student, i love being able to use the kindles in my doctoral work.	1
	i do miss the sd port that the first kindle has.	1
	i think that the next kindle should have the sd port again and a better place to hold the unit.	1
	still, i thank you amazon for a great product.	1
	not bad.i just got my kindle dx.	1
	i didn't own the other ones.	1
	i don't think it is bad at all, in fact i think it is pretty good.	1
	many people think the size is too big and compare the dx's size to a tablet or netbook.	1
	i have no problem with the size at all.	1
	i actually think the kindle dx is the perfect size.	1
	i can't image reading on something smaller.	1
	i love either placing a book down on my bed and reading or cradling a book with my arm.	1
	i need a couple of weeks with it to give a good review, but i just wanted to answer concerns with the size.      	1
	i can read books again, thank you kindle dx.i was an avid reader for years, gobbling down an average of four to five books a week for most of my life (including childhood) and even went so far as to parlay my booklove into a b.a.	1
	in english literature (hey, if they want to give me a college degree for reading books, which to me is as easy as breathing and a lot more fun, who am i to stop them?).	1
	three years ago suddenly i couldn't read anymore.	1
	many specialists later i was referred to johns hopkins hospital's wilmer eye institute where finally i was diagnosed with very dry eye and early onset oildrop cataracts (my eye color is so pale as to almost be transparent, which causes sunlight to be able to wreak havoc and i did not wear sunglasses like every opthamologist on the planet had been warning me to do for eons).	1
	that year, i read two books - all year.	1
	i could read for about 10 minutes before everything got so blurry i had to stop - and couldn't even see clearly around me.	1
	i read a total of four very short books over the subsequent two years.	1
	reading my favorite newsweek magazine was agony but hey, at least those articles are short ... since receiving the kindle dx a week and two days ago (it was a christmas gift that took awhile to get here due to the release of the second generation), i have read four books, averaging over 700 pages each.	1
	my hypothesis with the kindle dx was that the ability to greatly enlarge the type size, coupled with the larger screen of the dx showing more of the enlarged text on the screen at one time, would enable me to read again.	1
	not to mention the digital ink and background screen color designed to greatly reduce eye strain .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	it was a $489 gamble that paid off in spades.	1
	for anyone with the type of eye problems i have, or with macular degeneration, or even presbyopia, the kindle dx is like a gift from heaven.	1
	i cried real tears when i turned the kindle dx on for the first time and started reading the online guide with the font size enlarged to its largest size with no eye strain and no blurs or halos even after half an hour.	1
	i have gone from being able to read for 10 minutes with a paper book to literally hours on end with the kindle dx.	1
	and i've charged it a grand total of one time and it didn't even need it.	1
	it was the first night after i got it and i wasn't sure and didn't want to risk it dying on me mid-book (although you can use it with the charger plugged in), so i charged it up while i slept.	1
	i didn't need to.	1
	3200 pages, many online kindle adventures, and some mp3s later, it's still got 1/8 charge left.	1
	i think i can finish the book i'm currently reading before i have to charge 'er up.	1
	and none of this testifies to all the many other completely nifty things it does and does quite well.	1
	for example, i removed my new kindle dx from the box, read the onscreen guide for 15 minutes, and then went online to my facebook account and updated my status: 'i just got my amazon kindle dx and i using it this very minute to write this status update!	1
	ya' gotta' love technology!'	1
	i received bunches of comments from my facebook friends saying they were going to go try that out immediately with the kindle they got for christmas - and then i read a bunch of status updates from all my fellow kindle pals.	1
	it's a fun break to take from all the hours upon hours of reading i'm doing now.	1
	and i haven't even talked about the ultimate joy and gratification of deciding i want to read a book - in fact, deciding that i am dying to read the next book in the series i'm halfway through - and whamo, i use the kindle's 3g wireless, go to the kindle store, download the book, and i'm literally reading it in less than two minutes from start to finish.	1
	talk about instant gratification.	1
	the joke now is that i am no longer a bibliophile; i am a biblionaut.	1
	the kindle dx has truly taken me to infinity and beyond!	1
	i have nothing negative to say about it.	1
	i'm sure if i dropped it or sat on it or allowed a tractor-trailer to run it over, the screen would break.	1
	since i don't plan on doing any of those things, i'm not terribly worried.	1
	i treat it with respect, have taken it to work (carefully), have tossed it on the bed, and it has taken these minor lickins' and kept on tickin'.	1
	it seems as sturdy as is appropriate.	1
	you can't expect something like this to be the technological equivalent of a cockroach and survive a nuclear holocaust.	1
	i could wish it was a wee bit lighter in weight.	1
	it is definitely heavier than a paperback, but not heavier than the average hardback book.	1
	this is not a negative; i was always too cheap to buy hardbacks, so am more used to the featherweight of paperbacks.	1
	and as for the kindle dx disappearing into the background while my mind totally carries me away into the world the author has created for me with simple, yet elegant words and only that, just words - imagine that!!!	1
	- i'm getting little tears again because it absolutely happens just like with a book and i have missed that ultimate reading experience for so long.	1
	i am currently researching various states' laws to see if i can marry my kindle dx.	1
	(yes, i am kidding ... but not much.)	1
	a rare piece of technology that becomes a game-changer.	1
	don't get swindled.proprietary software and proprietary formats are vehicles for theexercise of power by some over others.	1
	companies that claim ownershipover the software and formats involved in the delivery of informationbecome gatekeepers determining who can and cannot access thatinformation.	1
	the point isn't whether the people who claim such power --and are granted it by our legal system -- use it for good or bad.	1
	thepoint is that they shouldn't have it at all.	1
	but as it turns outanyway, they generally use it for bad.	1
	the amazon kindle (more appropriately known as the 'swindle'), whichuses proprietary software to distribute ebooks in proprietary formatswithin a digital restrictions management (drm) scheme, is an exampleof a company claiming and being granted power they shouldn't have overbooks and the terms under which we can access them.	1
	amazon's speedy move to shut off the kindle's text-to-speech (tts)capabilities in response to complaints by the authors guild was aclear demonstration of this power.	1
	authors guild president roy blount,jr.	1
	borrowed defective by design's 'kindle swindle' monicker as theheadline for his new york times op-ed piece complaining that the ttsfeature infringed on authors' rights.	1
	amazon twiddled some bits andsuddenly all kindles refused to read certain titles aloud.	1
	it's stilla mystery why a computerized voice reading a book aloud to you in yourhome is infringement on any author's right -- but in this case, it'samazon's secret software that makes the law.	1
	this action sparked a backlash that is still gaining momentum.	1
	blindpeople have been protesting in large numbers, because the tts featureis incredibly useful to them.	1
	their point is powerful -- taking itfurther, we should not be content with case-specific exemptions.	1
	theproblem isn't that amazon and the publishers don't use the powerproperly, it's that they have it at all.	1
	in this case, they used it ina manner that disproportionately impacted blind users, and that waswrong.	1
	but if they retain the power, they will be able to use it lateragainst someone else.	1
	update: they just made this prediction come true, by remotely deletingpurchased copies of 1984 and animal farm from hundreds of kindles.along with the books, they deleted students' annotations on the books.	1
	this has not been the only such instance.	1
	earlier this year, defectiveby design supporters sent amazon ceo jeff bezos jars of peach babyfood -- a reference to an episode of seinfeld where kramer is bannedfrom his favorite fruit market for attempting to return a peach -- tocall attention to amazon's ban of a user for returning too many amazonpurchases; a ban which prevented the user not only from purchasing anyebooks for his kindle but also from accessing ebooks he had alreadypurchased.	1
	though the ban was rescinded after the outcry, the leopardhad shown its spots.	1
	amazon spokeswoman cinthia portugal told wired that 'amazon isagnostic when it comes to drm with ebooks,' and that they 'givecontent owners the choice.'	1
	while amazon has been a positive force inthe world of drm-free music, they are anything but a neutral party inthe ebook world.	1
	they control the format, the device, and the storewhere the media for the device is purchased.	1
	if all they wanted to dowas 'give content owners the choice,' then why did they send a dmcatakedown notice to a site hosting a tool which facilitated loadingbooks from other companies onto the kindle?	1
	statements like portugal's show amazon's strategy: don't look behindthe curtain.	1
	trying to get an exact description of what the drm on thekindle does is impossible.	1
	drm is not even mentioned much lessexplained -- outside of user-contributed reviews -- on the purchase pagefor the kindle.	1
	and yet, while the kindle already does support somedrm-free formats, access to the restricted kindle store is the featurebeing marketed most heavily by amazon.	1
	whatever happens with the kindle, we need to work to eliminate drm onall ebooks.	1
	here are some things you can do to protest theserestrictions and promote drm-free ebooks: don't get swindled.	1
	other portable devices can both run free softwareand read drm-free ebooks.	1
	fbreader is free software that runs onandroid mobile devices, the openmoko freerunner, and other systemsrunning gnu/linux.	1
	the bebook e-ink device publishes their readersoftware as free software under the gnu general public license (gpl).as of this writing, the bebook still includes a proprietary module fordrm support, but maybe if enough people request it, they will offer acompletely drm-free version.	1
	support authors who offer their ebooks without drm.	1
	creative commonslicenses sensibly prohibit drm, so look for books under licenses likecc-by-nd, cc-by and cc-by-sa.	1
	another group of authors is working totag all of their own drm-free ebooks with 'drmfree' on amazon.	1
	insist that amazon start being honest about their drm.	1
	write to amazonasking them to answer author cory doctorow's questions about drm -- andpublish your letter online.	1
	if amazon is just doing what the authorswant, then why aren't they answering him?	1
	hand out copies of 'the right to read.'	1
	richard stallman's short storyillustrates the kind of world we can expect if we buy into proprietarydevices, proprietary formats, and drm for our ebooks.	1
	review the reviewers.	1
	write to tech reviewers and point out that theyfailed to mention the kindle or other device's drm restrictions intheir review.	1
	some reviewers wield a lot of influence -- people likedavid pogue of the new york times.	1
	it's mystifying that they excludesuch an important misfeature when they review devices in this genre.	1
	together we can achieve the same in the arena of ebooks that we haveachieved in music -- a widespread recognition that people will nolonger tolerate drm.	1
	great device for academics and professionals.	1
	own it; love it; pdf great.	1
	other issues addressed.i got my kindle a few hours ago, which may seem like too soon to review it, but... i checked what i needed and am loving it!	1
	some of the reviews say pdf is  fine, but no real review of it.	1
	others say it is not so great, but many of them do not own it... surprise.	1
	i bought this because no other device i have displays double column pdf's worth a darn, not even my samsung tablet pc.	1
	kindle dx has a bigger screen, so i thought the risk might be worth it.	1
	yes it was!!	1
	while i cannot change fonts, the font on my pdf's is quite readable, even better when landscape mode.	1
	i have the first generation sony 500, which screwed me on the folder or grouping section.	1
	they put out the 505 with it, but did not care enough to upgrade their first gens.	1
	so, i am in the same boat with kindle, yet i am not going to bollux it up with hundreds of books.	1
	i can always change in and out later.	1
	i will be using more of my documents than kindle's anyway.	1
	back to pdf: i mentioned the sony.	1
	i have an ipod touch.	1
	i have every toy that ever existed, save for an irex tablet, which is supposed to do pdf's better, but i still don't think they can change the font.	1
	i won't even complain about the cost of this.	1
	i finally have my pdf fix.	1
	linux, of all things!	1
	: i plugged it into my linux, and i am able to drag and drop just like on the pc and mac.	1
	woohoo!	1
	1984: amazon refunded the money.	1
	had i already read the book, and they took it back with refund, i would be pretty darned happy.	1
	that said, does anyone know that orwell is in the public domain in many countries, and that you can get the text files gratis?	1
	cover for the kindle: first, this came with a generic screen protector, which will probably last me a while.	1
	i took someone's idea of a ziplock, and that will work for the moment, until i get a better cover and a screen protector which i will ruin trying to get out the bubbles.	1
	i'm not cheap, mind you.	1
	i am just tired of buying screen protectors that you have to take ten valium (to keep from shaking) to put the thing on without messing up.	1
	all of the other issues that people brought up, i am aware of, and still bought it, so there will be no real negative point made in this review.	1
	newspaper users: you do know that most of these papers have their own websites you can go to for free?	1
	that said, i would pay for a site that truly gave me the full news experience.... ads to boot.	1
	now wouldn't that help save the newspapers, knowing they could sell ads and people would see them on their kindle.	1
	perhaps you don't like ads, but it should help drive down cost.	1
	i pay 8/month for a hard copy of my local paper.	1
	if they had an online addition and charged less, i would buy it.	1
	newspapers, get smart!	1
	though it ways just over a pound, i don't feel it is very heavy, and i can comfortably read with it at several distances from my eyes.	1
	oh, and compared to other readers, there is more text on each page, yet it is more 'readable'.	1
	so, i have my pdfs and books in much less weight than a laptop, notebook, etc.	1
	on the news they complained that the text to speech pronounced obama a little off, c'mon!	1
	this technology has come a long way, but it's not perfect.	1
	be thankful for it.	1
	i can adjust to obaaama.	1
	missing things or not: people that want videos on this thing may as well by a tablet pc or a pmp.	1
	more than half the idea of a reading device (to me) is to get away from the vidiocy of my normal routine.	1
	thank you, amazon.	1
	my quest stops here!	1
	neat tool, but perhaps not for professors or those needing full pdf functionality.i received my dx and was eager to use it on travels.	1
	for work, i need to have access to lots of pdfs, and thus far i have used my macbookair to keep them handy and catalogued with my endnote program.	1
	i was eager to be able to read pdfs and make annotations that i could later import into endote to keep for later use.	1
	but, you cannot clip text from pdf files--they are more in a picture format.	1
	the note function seems a bit clunky too, so it really was not going to be a tool i could use to keep notes on or from the articles i read.	1
	i also felt like the dx would fall out of my hands when i tried to enter text.	1
	i was able to annotate text from books, and that was really cool.	1
	i did not really get to copying the text to import into endnote, because i ended up sending the dx back.	1
	i have more functionality going back and forth between my mbair to read pdfs and my iphone to read books.	1
	its a pretty cool gizmo, but i think in 5 years we will be stunned by the limited functionality that people would tolerate or accept at a rate of $500.	1
	in the end, i just felt like the $500 plus cost for books i'd need to buy, along with the very limited functionality for note-taking and organizing pdfs just did not seem worth it.	1
	in the end, i also realized that when i read books, i do so at the beach, in the tub, and in other places where electric technology would be put at risk.	1
	in short, this was not a good enough work tool to complicate my life by adding it into (given the value added), and as a relaxation tool, it was very limiting, even for reading books.	1
	but the quality seems solid, the customer support appears excellent, and i applaud amazon for pioneering this media.       	1
	can't buy it - yet..as a lawyer, i would love to own this unit for business use.	1
	two things are holding me back: 1) the price is still too high.	1
	dx charges a very premium price.	1
	this is ok, as long as your product is near perfect.	1
	the dx is still a work in progress and has many known kinks that need to be worked out; i could probably even overlook the price but .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	2) no file structure?	1
	really?	1
	device cannot be treated as a serious business or academic device without a file structure.	1
	i would plan to dump 1000+ pdf documents into kindle on day one.	1
	without a file structure, i'll never be able to find them again.      	1
	b&n;  nook makes me ebay my dx.	1
	amazon, please update fw.	1
	my best gift to me.	1
	brilliant !.	1
	use kindle dx outside usa.i have been using dx for three days in provincial china, where 3g service is sporadic.	1
	and, of course i would always try to avoid the international delivery fee of $1.99 per item for single purchases or $4.99 per week for subscriptions.	1
	so, when i found that amazon.com now allows me to download my newsweek and forbes via computer and usb, i am delighted!	1
	i guess this also applies to newspaper subscriptions, though i would feel bored to download them daily from computer.	1
	when there is 3g service around me (such as in some of the biz centers of this city), i can browse the kindle store for free, which is definitely a plus, esp when i am reading some book reviews in the magazines and then want to check whether there is a kindle edition of the book that interests me.	1
	all in all, kindle dx is perfect product (hardware speaking)and perfect for international travelers (service and software speaking).      	1
	screen is easy on the eyes, like reading a a real book.i was looking at e-readers and although i'm not a book worm i do enjoy reading non-fiction books as a change from tv and video games.	1
	let me tell you the dx is just beautiful for reading.	1
	the print looks like laser printed mylar, the e-ink technology is so easy on the eyes.	1
	i started reading and i didn't put the thing down for the next 4 hours.	1
	i like the 3g connectivity and it's worldwide, and no monthly charge unlike the ipad is going to charge for 3g.	1
	i think as an e-reader this is the device to get.	1
	forget the ipad, unless you want to be distracted from reading a good book, this device is good at what it's made for, being an e-reader.	1
	it has simple browsing, but that's not what this device is for.	1
	if you like to read but don't want to lug around a bunch of books, this is the gadget to get.	1
	as for the size, it's fine for me, not too big.	1
	it's like reading a hard cover book.	1
	i got the m-edge case to protect it.	1
	i normally don't read that often but this device is going to make me read me.      	1
	great device, but lacking some features.	1
	kim's kindle 9.7 review.i purchased the new kindle dx 9.7' screen for my husband for our anniversary this year.	1
	before i purchased the kindle, i had purchased the sony prs500.	1
	did not like the sony and took it back and waited until the new kindle was available.	1
	well worth the wait.	1
	the screen size is perfect and easy to read.	1
	this kindle is very thin and very easy to maneuver around when purchasing  books-magazines and newspapers.	1
	i looked at all readers and this one is the best for what we need it for.	1
	hoping to get myself one after i am done with my paper books.	1
	my husband loves it.	1
	the wireless works perfectly.	1
	it was also great to have this kindle pre-registered and my account set up and ready to purchase books right away.	1
	no problems.	1
	will definitely get another one for myself.        	1
	superb.i ordered the kindle from amazon.com on 2 feb and it arrived today, 5 feb. very impressive as it comes from the usa.	1
	downloaded my first book in under 60 secs and found the set up instuctions easy to follow.	1
	it is now charging as i used amazon.co.uk to get a uk adaptor.	1
	i think i am going to enjoy being a kindle owner.      	1
	kindle makes reading easier.i got a kindle for christmas!	1
	a kindle dx to be exact, meaning it's the large version.	1
	a friend of mine asked to share my opinion of it on facebook.	1
	i told her that i would write a review after i had used it for a few weeks, so here it is.	1
	i really love my kindle.	1
	the few minor problems that i have encountered do not stop me from enjoying it.	1
	the very best thing about the kindle is that it makes reading as physically effortless as it was when i was in college.	1
	i had not even realized how much more effort i had been making to read recently until i started reading books and periodicals -- especially periodicals -- on the kindle.	1
	the ease of reading on the kindle is only partly due to the ability to increase the font size.	1
	i can increase the font size on my laptop, but the kindle is still easier to read.	1
	i think the clarity of the font, the particular ratio of print-background contrast and the all-lighting-friendly screen play a part, too.	1
	i must say that there are times when it would be nice if the kindle screen could be backlit -- reading a night in a car, for instance -- but i would never trade that feature for a decrease in ease of reading.	1
	reading a kindle in bedwhen you buy a kindle, you get a special kindle email address that you can use to send documents to your kindle.	1
	you can send them two ways: converted-for-kindle and unconverted.	1
	conversion costs 15 cents per megabyte.	1
	since there are very few documents that are heavier than a meg, you can basically count on paying 15 cents per document.	1
	i always convert, because then i can change the font size, which is very important to me when i'm reading a .pdf file.	1
	here's how i put interesting articles from the web on my kindle in order to comfortably reread them later: i use my browser's 'print' command to create a .pdf file, save in on my hard drive, and send it with the 'convert' command to my kindle.	1
	(note: you need to have adobe acrobat writer on your computer in order to create a .pdf file in this manner.)	1
	i haven't used the bookmarking and highlighting features, but my daughter has.	1
	she's reading her english assignment, orwell's 1984, on my kindle.	1
	this brings me to a frustration that has nothing to do with amazon, but rather the publisher: some books do not have a table of contents!	1
	1984 does not, so my daughter has to remember to bookmark the beginning of chapters so that she can easily find them.	1
	i am currently reading elizabeth kostova's the historian, which does have a table of contents, so if i should like to go back to chapter three, for example, i can just click on it from the toc.	1
	kindle screenshot of new york times articlethe only time that an item on the kindle is difficult to read is when i must finish reading a blog or periodical article on the web.	1
	yes, the kindle has limited web-browsing capabilities, and no, finish-on-the-web is not something that amazon can control; the blog or periodical itself decides what appears in full on the kindle.	1
	for example, i subscribe to the vanity fair and huffington post blogs.	1
	i can read some of their articles in their entirety, and others must be finished on the web.	1
	(and, of course, if you follow a link in an article, you end up on the web.)	1
	using the web on the kindle can be difficult for two reasons: first, you can't always adjust the font size, and second, browsing with the kindle is rather slow.	1
	kindle has a new free service now in beta: kindle on your pc.	1
	it synchronizes your kindle ereader contents with a kindle application on your pc.	1
	a mac version is also in the works.	1
	when i first saw this, i wondered, if i have a kindle, why would i want this?	1
	then i realized that what they are really offering is kindle ebook/eperiodical service for people who do not have kindles.	1
	the only advantage to people who already have kindles, i think, is that you can look at illustrations in color.	1
	i'm going to try this, of course, to see what it's like.	1
	so, to jenny, and any other curious friends, i say, i'm glad i have a kindle!	1
	this review, with illustrations, appears on the afmarcom blog: [...] 	1
	new kindle.this is my 6th kindle, as i buy them as gifts for my daughter and grandson starting with the k1.	1
	the dx is an entirely new experience.	1
	i found three shortcomings: (1) its largest drawback is the lack of controls on the left side, (2) its weight when using the m-edge cover (but that's not kindle's fault), and (3) a lack of capability to do a global move from one kindle to another -- i had to download each title separately from the archive which amazon so nicely provides.	1
	the bright side of this is i was able to clean up my on-board library.	1
	but overall, it is a lot easier to read.	1
	i use the number 5 setting for the font which seems larger on the dx then on the k2.	1
	i especially like the sync feature and the landscape views.	1
	i found the landscape view handy when trying to determine the full title.	1
	as i read a lot of sagas (by authors such as richelle meade, cristine feehan, james patterson and w.e.b.	1
	griffin), i like to read them in the order of publication.	1
	by turning the unit to landscape, i can see the full title to include the book number, if any, which you cannot do when using portrait mode.	1
	i think the price is a little excessive at $489 plus the cost of the cover.	1
	but to me, it's worth it.	1
	i take it with me every where i go when i expect some down time, and with the m-edge cover which opens like an easel, i can prop the dx open and not have to hold it.	1
	i also found i increased the time i spend reading to about 2-1/2 hours a day and i don't get tired from reading as i did when i used paper books.	1
	all in all, if you have the $500+ to spend on a new reading experience, i highly recommend the dx.      	1
	happy but .....	1
	i love it!.i concur with the previous comments on all counts and would add:the dictionary function is the best.	1
	i take it everywhere and can't wait to download my next book.i have no issues with the side buttons.if you turn the wireless off, when it is not being used, the battery life lasts longer.	1
	magical carry-on reducer.	1
	very happy uk kindle owner.as someone who also purchased the  when it became internationally available last october, i waited with eager anticipation for the inevitable release of the .	1
	it was definitely worth the wait!	1
	yes, it's bigger and slightly heavier than the 6' kindle but that's precisely what made me buy it.	1
	it's still highly portable, deliciously slim and with the added bonus that the screen is, in my opinion, a much better size for all round reading.	1
	as always, international delivery by amazon was stunningly fast (ordered on day of release, kindle was in my hands less than two full days later) and my archived books, magazines and newspapers were ready and waiting for me when i turned the kindle on.	1
	virtually seamless delivery of content - just excellent.	1
	next up - pictures and graphs (and wider availability of titles) for non-us readers please :)      	1
	best christmas present..my son bought me a kindle for christmas.	1
	it was the best present i received.	1
	my daughter who is starting college liked it so much, i had a hard time getting it away from her.	1
	she bought her own kindle the same day and now we exchange books.	1
	i like being able to change the font and it is easy to take everywhere i go.	1
	it downloads books so fast and i like being able to sample a book before i buy it.	1
	all my friends are amazed and want one.  	1
	kindle dx - excellent product.	1
	heavy and still not perfect, but very helpful tool.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	kindle for quad.	1
	exactly what i expected.	1
	kindle dx wireless reading.	1
	attention rural owners!.i got my kindle dx for christmas and have had it for a little over 24 hours.	1
	i have been reading on it almost constantly except for sleeping in that time.	1
	i love it.	1
	i find myself forgetting that i am reading from an electronic device and try to turn the page.	1
	the only cons i find are the lack of a backlight, really for the price you pay it should include a backlight and the internet connection.	1
	i live in eastern kentucky in the appalachain mountains and our 3g service is non-existant.	1
	i will for the near future have to download my books to my computer and then to the kindle.	1
	it is painless process and one that i expected due to my location.	1
	never fear,if you live in a rural area you can still download your books in about a minute.	1
	i don't believe that amazon makes that clear enough.	1
	i also have the leather cover which is a great asset.       	1
	the kindle dx.	1
	my wife's kindle.	1
	i can finally move again.	1
	best invention of the 21st century!.	1
	perfect!.	1
	best thing going.	1
	awesome kindle.	1
	it is wonderful.	1
	although expensive, it's a must have.	1
	good stuff.i like it.	1
	it is the only device on the market that can display my pdf docs.	1
	the screen size is just enough to display the pdfs(i still need  to use some software to trim the white space on the pdf books, but it works).	1
	i am glad bought a refurbished kindle dx and no need to wait for the irex dr800sg.       	1
	love my kindle dx.	1
	i got this for my father, now getting one for my mother.....	1
	size matters!.	1
	awesome product.	1
	my first ebook.	1
	6 months and still loving it.	1
	kindle's my new bff.	1
	great, but still a work in progress..	1
	welcome to the future of books!.	1
	kick butt.	1
	best purchase i made this year.	1
	love the kindle.	1
	kindle dx review.	1
	rich p.	1
	terry.	1
	great reader, could use more books available and some usability tweaks.i have lots of books - my main furniture consists of bookcases - and i read things until the covers fall off.	1
	i love the idea of putting all the books onto one device, sort of a giant ipod for books.	1
	too bad many of my favorite authors don't seem to be available yet in electronic form... hopefully they will come along soon.	1
	my friend gave me this for my birthday (expensive gift!	1
	hugz to you if you ever see this!	1
	)and i love it!my son keeps eyeing it and wanting one, so it has the 'cool' factor.	1
	i have two little tiny things that bug me on the usability front, because i notice such things.	1
	first, because my hands are small i keep hitting the menu button with my thunb while reading a book.	1
	ease of reach is important, avoiding inadvertent actuation of controls is also important.	1
	if the buttons were further in from the edge this would not be a problem.	1
	second, also probably because my hands are not huge, i hold it below the halfway balnce point, which makes it slightly top heavy.	1
	if you don't read much this isn't a factor, but if you read for hours then the thumb and wrist tendons become fatigued.	1
	this could be alleviated with a weight in the lower part of the case, or by changing the balance point.	1
	ergonomics are a factor here and of course the design has to accommodate users from the small end of the spectrum to the large end.	1
	however, since the balance point is exactly the middle, i suspect that no deliberate change was made to the design for this issue.	1
	all in all, i love this and use it all the time.	1
	looking forward to more titles!      	1
	great gift.this was a great gift.	1
	works well-fast downloads, good prices.	1
	good selection including free and massive collections that are cheap.	1
	great for travel.	1
	screen is large and clear and easy on the eyes.	1
	buttons are well placed, easy to use and the 'keyboard' is easy to use as well.	1
	a few negatives--text to speech is 'flat', browser is not very functional, and no color.	1
	none of these is a major problem.	1
	if you read a lot this is for you.	1
	particularly with the cover it has the feel of a large (light) paperback.	1
	the pdf reader is a good plus.      	1
	i love this cool gadget.	1
	works as advertised.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	kindle dx review.	1
	worth every penny.	1
	save your money and buy a netbook, way overpriced!.my comments say it all, this device is not worth $500.00, why is a limited device more expensive than most modern netbooks and some fine laptops that can do way more than this overpriced gadget, heck i get more use out of my iphone!      	1
	kindle dx and a lefty.	1
	also, very brief comparison of the kindle 2nd gen and dx..some of the reviews of the dx ought to be available for download as short stories, in and of themselves!	1
	so i won't belabor the review issues.	1
	in short, we had both the kindle 2nd gen and the dx in our home at the same time; the kindle 2nd gen malfunctioned so we sent it back, but before we did, we ordered the dx and kept it.	1
	what a blessing!	1
	my lefty wife turned it 180 and locked the screen position.	1
	she prefers the buttons out of the way, (now at the top), and the next page button is now at her left thumb.	1
	my subjective opinion is that the kindle 2nd gen provides too cramped a reading space, (but it's my wifes kindle so that wasn't a consideration).	1
	we find *.pdf book drafts from time to time and with the dx the file download and compatability/usability issues don't exist.	1
	she prefers it naked so we bought the m-edge neoprene sleeve/slip case....another outstanding product.      	1
	best yet.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	just joined the e-reader club.	1
	kindle two is fabulous!	1
	!.	1
	very fine kindle.as an inventor living on both coasts---this is the best kindle.	1
	i can read the newspapers from both coasts as i travel---read patents that i have pdf'd to the kindle----and in between read the latest book i have an interest in.	1
	this is better than a computer for the traveler.	1
	get it!      	1
	just love it.i am not a geek with electronics.	1
	this is very user friendly, great for travel and home.	1
	i love the screen, it reads much like a book not a screen.	1
	if your on the edge...as i was, go for it!      	1
	almost perfect...a few suggestions.i see this as eventually replacing newspapers and magazines, let alone books.	1
	i wish it had wifi so it could surf the net while in a wifi hotspot.	1
	like the iphone, the kindle represents a totally new direction for a product, but its full potential has yet to be explored.	1
	the display is great, and hits the goal of appearing as print on paper.	1
	i think some of the content suppliers could format for this product better, but i realize that will take time.	1
	i can also see the kindle scrolling smoothly like the iphone.	1
	i realize that the look of the printed page was a goal, but while the display's static image hits that goal, i would suggest going beyond what the page can do with regard to scrolling and perhaps windows to other articles...also, it would be nice if the price were a bit lower...      	1
	fantastic and fun reading.this reader is amazing!	1
	downloads are fast and the library is huge.	1
	the screen utilizing the e-ink technology is very readable and clear, with great grayscale images as well.	1
	prior to owning this device, i never really had or took time for recreational reading, but with the kindle dx, i can't wait to get back to reading my growing library of books, periodicals, and news media.	1
	for me personally, one of the most helpful features is the ability to vary the font size.	1
	i can even read without my glasses on, if i want, with very little fatigue due to the extremely clear e-ink screen.	1
	sure, there's more frequent page turning with a larger font, but the device is so well designed that this is not a bother to me at all.	1
	i have looked at other brands of readers, and this is by far the very best version of the very best reader there is.	1
	enjoy!      	1
	what the ipod is to music, the kindle is to books.i bought my first kindle 1 last year around november, i loved it.	1
	it was small, it was not great with images, but at the same time the pluses far outweighed the minuses.	1
	i watched the kindle 2 come out and was very tempted, but held off.	1
	i was contacted to be part of a beta test for the dx.	1
	once i saw that, i knew i would be buying one when they hit the market.	1
	i've had my kindle dx since june, and it is an amazing device.	1
	for my needs, the kindle is perfect.	1
	i am either always reading a new technical book (usually large and heavy) or i like to keep a few reference sources with me, i travel every other week, and i enjoy reading...a lot.	1
	the unit itself works very well.	1
	power consumption is not an issue, if you are getting low...just turn wireless off.	1
	it lasts for days and days.	1
	the display is great, very easy to read even in direct sunlight.	1
	you can very comfortably sit around the pool and read your kindle dx without any display issues.	1
	the content for recreational reading is great, the content for technical books continues to grow and recently i have seen wrox and o'reilly series are available.	1
	the changes to the interface are very well done.	1
	it is more intuitive, easier to navigate, and the display is a perfect size.	1
	my grandfather bought one after i showed him how it works.	1
	we both love the built in dictionary.	1
	the adjustable font size makes reading a much easier experience for him.	1
	i subscribe to the la times, which is there every morning when i turn my kindle on.	1
	the format is very easy to read and i spend about 1/2 as much time as i normally would flipping through pages.	1
	i've just started sending pdf files over to my kindle, what a great feature this is.	1
	they are very clear, easy to download, and always accessible.	1
	i recently forgot to pack my kindle before a trip, i ended up using the kindle app on my iphone.	1
	the shared library was so functional and easy.	1
	it takes seconds to download a book on my iphone if i really need to.	1
	the reading experience is not the same of course, but the fact that i can read a book on my kindle, be stuck someplace waiting and continue reading on my iphone, and the pages automatically synch to the furthest read page....sooooo cool.	1
	it is an exciting time for reading devices, there is a lot of competition and a lot of ground breaking technology is coming into play.	1
	just like anything else though, it's all about the content.	1
	having amazon as the content delivery system for any device is where the big win is.	1
	if i had to synch up with my pc or something goofy to get content onto my reader, it would not be nearly as enjoyable.	1
	i have downloaded books while getting ready for takeoff (prior to the warning about turning off all devices).	1
	it is just too convenient.	1
	i am a huge fan of books, always have been and always will be.	1
	but there is nothing superior about reading a paper based book vs. reading the same book electronically.	1
	the feel of paper and the weight of a book are emotional indicators...but once you have read a few books with the kindle, it's the same experience.	1
	except it always remembers your page, and you can annotate notes, and it will read it to you if you like, or play music in the background, and the pages don't blow in the wind, and it weighs a fraction of what your books weigh, and you can slip it into your backpack or purse not even noticing the weight, and something i read recently  which i had not thought of...you know where your kindle has been.	1
	ever seen the seinfeld episode where george was trying to return a book he had in the bathroom and it was 'flagged'.	1
	obviously i love my kindle(s), are they perfect...no.	1
	would i like to see some better images or color...yes.	1
	but it's a great device at this time.	1
	the future will bring what it brings.	1
	and the price is not trivial...but well worth it.       	1
	size does matter.the new bigger kindle is an improvement - the larger screen and larger type face for those of us with visual difficulties both make life easier.	1
	shopping by wireless is fun and having international newspapers delivered instantly is a marvel.	1
	books are easy to read.	1
	any improvements?	1
	i would like more conversion of images in both newspapers and books.	1
	i'd also like bigger keys or more striking labeling.      	1
	kindle dx.very cool technology.	1
	in some ways better than a book, in some ways the book still rules.	1
	i bought the dx thinking i was going to get the wall street journal.	1
	they raised the price of the kindle wsj, and at the same time wsj offered a subscription to the paper version for $50 for a year.	1
	the smaller version of the kindle would be absolutely fine for regular books, and easier to carry and hold as well.	1
	i live in a rural area outside san diego, and while i get normal cell phone reception, i have to leave the house to get a book to download (or hook it to my computer).	1
	i also find the downloads typically take closer to 5 minutes rather than the best case, advertised 1 minute.	1
	i like the paging function, i like reading it, i like that i can have many  books on the device at any one time.	1
	its nice to have the pdf reader built in.	1
	battery life is very acceptable as long as i don't leave it in the mode where its trying to find a signal, then the batteries last less than a day.	1
	normally they last 2 or more weeks.	1
	i bought the hard leather cover, and feel that its a requirement if you are going to carry the kindle anywhere.	1
	the screen would be too easily damaged without it.	1
	i worry about the kindle getting too hot in the car.	1
	so when i go to my girlfriends house, i take the kindle inside.	1
	when i leave however to do errands etc on the way home, its a very real possibility that it could be permanently damaged by heat in the car.	1
	i have to plan my stops, and skip some if i have the kindle with me (or take it with me, but that can be cumbersome too).	1
	i really miss the ability to share a book i've read.	1
	every book i read that i like, i want to be able to lend it to one of my friends or family that i know would enjoy it.	1
	that just doesn't work with the kindle.	1
	and i do miss the feel and smell of books.	1
	i also miss not being able read the front and back covers, along with the reviews in the front, not to mention some of the graphics and pictures.	1
	i could get over all that to have the other benefits of kindle if it weren't for the lack of ability to share what i've read.	1
	now that i'm used to the touch screen on the iphone, i find the kindle interface frustrating to have to translate what i want to do to using the menu and little joystick.	1
	i'm used to the kindle now, but it feels like old technology to not have the touch screen.	1
	while over 300,000 books sounds like a lot, i have found a number of books i wanted to read that are not available for the kindle.	1
	frustrating.	1
	big difference between many choices, and 'anything you want to read'.	1
	for traveling, reading in bed, instant access to books, remembering the last page read, and using the dictionary, the kindle is outstanding.	1
	there is clearly a place for this marvel.	1
	however, i still miss a good physical book.      	1
	kindle dx is awesome!.i never owned a kindle before my dx, so i am not familiar with the upgrades as well as others, but what i can say is: all the promotional advertisements are true.	1
	the kindle dx has definitely lived up to what the ads say.	1
	i have my library of books everywhere i go now.	1
	i love it!      	1
	good with room for improvement.reading on the kindle dx is great.	1
	there is no shortage of books and the control of the font size is really nice.	1
	prosnice device, feels good in the hands, well madetons of books to choose fromeasy to usegreat control over things like the font sizegreat battery lifenetwork connectivity is really nice consfont setting you make in books don't carry over to device menus, kindle store, or notes (major flaw)no control over contrastthe keyboard is an absolute joke.	1
	too small to use and the printed letters are so small i need reading glasses to see them.	1
	one of the big benefits of the kindle is it's ability to make the text large when reading a book and the keys on the keyboard don't stay with that.i wish i could browse the web on it.	1
	in a future version i think touch screen would really make this a better device.	1
	that being said it's really a good product.        	1
	kindle book prices.just received my new kindle dx and it's just what i expected and i'm well pleased with it.	1
	then i started to look for kindle books to order expecting to find decent prices.	1
	what i found was prices for new books coming out, like james patterson's ''i cross'', john sandford's ''rough country'', and ''vince flynn's ''pursuit of honor'' were just about $1.00 less than the non-kindle book price.	1
	one of amazon's selling points is a much lower price for kindle books, but what i find is not the case.	1
	i buy books when they first come out, i don't want to wait a couple of months for the price to drop to kindles $9.99.	1
	if kindle book prices remain high for best sellers that just hit the street,i can go to sam's and pay the same as i'd pay by shopping at amazon.	1
	if i have to do that maybe i don't need a kindle.	1
	paul      	1
	best birthday ever!.i bought the kindle dx as a birthday present to myself and it was the best purchase i have ever made.	1
	since i bought the device about a month ago i have read everyday and have completed well over 10 books.	1
	i have even revisited some of the classics that are free downloads from the kindle store!	1
	if you love reading, you will love this device!	1
	the screen is large and so easy to read.	1
	for people who are concerned about the tactile experience of holding a book and turning pages, i promise you won't be disappointed.	1
	the device is weighted in ways that are very similar to books and there are plenty of opportunities to 'turn pages.'	1
	this device has far exceeded my expectations and now i'm trying to find ways to integrate even more parts of my life into the device.	1
	uploading my schedule for the week (pdf format) and my songs for a little background music.	1
	i keep finding new features and opportunities with the kindle dx and i can't wait to see what more there is to come!      	1
	kindle dx the most fantastic unit - a must have.the kindle dx is extremely easy to use and easy to read.	1
	within 10 minutes i had gone through the instructions and ordered my first 16 books, a few of them free.	1
	the others were at minimum $2 less than costco's prices.	1
	it's easy to hold; it returns to previous pages or items quickly; the print is perfect for tired eyes, but can be changed easily too.	1
	the dictionary is terrific.	1
	i seldom need it, but when i do, phew, it's thorough.	1
	the only problem that i've found so far is that i'm using waaaay too much and will have to also buy my husband and son one each as i don't like to share!      	1
	kinkle dx.	1
	the perfect reader.i love this book reader!!	1
	having any book i want at my fingertips whenever i want is so delicious!	1
	i like the covers that are offered (got a red one) and will be getting the light.	1
	i do wish it had a built in light, but, it's great as it is.	1
	this is the perfect gift for yourself or someone who loves to read.	1
	i carry it everywhere, it fits right into my bag.	1
	i recommend the kindle dx to everyone.      	1
	excellent for the avid no clutter reader!.this is great!	1
	for anyone who is complaining you need to remember that they just came out only a year ago and are still trying to make perfections.	1
	i have been extremely happy and have had no difficulties at the present time.	1
	thanks amazon!	1
	my only question is why is there an app for the iphone and not other companies?	1
	especially since you use sprint (crappy company) for the tower signal.	1
	anyhow, if you would get apps for other services too, i would be over the moon!	1
	thanks again.scarlett      	1
	kindle dx.this is a fantastic item.	1
	i am really enjoying it and i am still discovering all the terrific things it can do.	1
	i would recommend it to everyone.      	1
	kindle dx.	1
	excellent reader.	1
	kindle dx.this product is a wonderful thing with room for improvement.	1
	it needs to be able to produce tables and charts and carry more photos but not having advertisements while reading the newspaper is great!	1
	i will be pleased when there are more books available as the selection now is quite limited and i feel rather expensive when a used hard copy can be purchased for half the price.	1
	i was also dismayed, at the price of the product, that the cover is sold separately and rather expensive.	1
	i should have done more research before making my purchase but overall i am very pleased with the concept and the usage.      	1
	almost perfect.i absolutely love my new kindle dx.	1
	it does almost everything i could hope for in an e-book reader.	1
	i am away from home a lot in my job so the wireless 'whispernet' feature allows me to easily download books on the go.	1
	i can also keep up to date automatically with daily newspapers or periodic magazine subscriptions.	1
	the larger screen in nice especially when looking at charts and graphs in pdf documents.	1
	the only negative point i have about the kindle dx is that pdfs are not searchable.	1
	the kindle treats them like a scanned document and does not recognize the words of the document.	1
	other than that, the kindle dx allows me to carry all my work documents and manuals plus any personal and professional reading in a single, small package wherever i go.      	1
	kindle dx review.the unit appears to be solid, and performs well.	1
	my main complaint, is a lot of the books i want to read are not on kindle.	1
	i clicked 'tell the publisher you want to read this book on kindle', but so far none of them have shown up.	1
	secondly, is you can't go to a table of contents, and pick a chapter of page to goto.      	1
	kindle dx.i have had my kindle for about a month so far, and i love my kindle dx and very happy with my purchase.	1
	so far, the couple of drawbacks i have seen and would like to see in future kindles is that i really, really wish it had a backlight so i could read it when it starts to get dark.	1
	when it starts to get dusk or when we go camping, my husband goes to bed early, i would like to read my kindle so i don't disturb him and without having to have the stupid separate light.	1
	i'm always trying to figure out where i had put it last.	1
	also, i don't care for how the screen rotates automatically.	1
	i would prefer it to rotate when i indicate it should.	1
	because i have problems with my arms and wrists, i tend to hold my book at a slant and the kindle will rotate the screen, frustrating me to no end.	1
	and, lastly, i would like the kindle to accept html's without having to send them amazon to reformat and then amazon charging me for each book they reformat.	1
	i had an old rocket so i have lots and lots of html's.	1
	i believe i shouldn't be charged anything to reformat any of my ebooks to load onto my kindle.	1
	other than those few drawbacks, i would really recommend the kindle dx.	1
	because it can hold so many books, i really like the idea of putting all my books on my kindle so i can read, and re-read, any of my books at any time.	1
	i carry it with me everywhere.	1
	good job, amazon.	1
	just correct those minor problems and you would have an absolute winner and one i would eagerly upgrade to.      	1
	first kindle purchase, started w/ dx.being an avid reader, the task of disposing, trading, donating read books can become tiresome.	1
	i finally decided to purchase the dx.	1
	although, i still think it is expensive, i really really like using it.	1
	only once has a book been purchased that i did not intend to buy, (still confused how it happened), but i understand there is a way to remove books that were not supposed to be purchased.	1
	although i feel like i need to get a larger handbag to fit the dx with it's cover, it is not difficult to transport around.	1
	no one knows what i'm reading, or half the time what i'm doing with the device.	1
	and no more books stacked up in a corner!	1
	i would recommend only for the avid reader, otherwise, it is an expensive device that you'll never get your money worth.       	1
	big screen beauty.i've owned a kindle 1 and a tiny kindle 2.  i received my kindle dx 3 weeks ago, so i'm writing from a bit of a perspective.my perspective - this thing is huge!!!!	1
	!this is the best of the 3 kindles because of the big, beautiful screen.	1
	i've read all the negative whining about the weight, the inability to fit it into a little purse, etc.	1
	etc.	1
	!the weight doesn't bother me and i don't have a purse.but what i do get is the same feeling i got when i first hooked up my 24' monitor to my macbookpro = wow!	1
	this kindle is expansive.	1
	i think the decision to go with one set of buttons is inspired.	1
	you want them on the other side - turn the dx upside down.	1
	i'm enjoying my dx - i even enjoy work with it!      	1
	love it!.i am really pleased with the kindle dx - i live in the 'boonies' in alaska and the whispernet works great...even in my house which doesn't get cell phone reception for most cell phones.	1
	the reader is a wonderful change from heavy books, but there are many more aspects i haven't explored with it yet...too busy reading!      	1
	terrific.	1
	great way to read.	1
	kindle dx.i have had the kindle dx for a month now and just love it.	1
	i travel a lot and it sure beats taking hardback books with me.	1
	the downloads take only a few moments.	1
	i have recommended this product to others who love to read a lot.	1
	with the larger screen it is just like reading a book      	1
	love it!.i didn't know if i should spend the extra and buy big but i'm glad i did as i love the bigger size.	1
	i think if i worked or traveled a lot the smaller one would be better but i don't and this is perfect.	1
	i would love to see the cover of the books in color, maybe they will fix that next time.      	1
	i miss the book a bit but what a great experience!.overall i prefer seeing a real book, holding a real book and being able to flip through to see how many more pages i have left in a chapter -- however, in terms of actual reading the kindle is superb.	1
	since you can choose your own print size you can make the reading process as easy as you remember it being back when you were younger and could actually see.i also really appreciate being able to select a new book and getting it delivered so quickly.	1
	the price is right on most of those selections - especially the classics which are almost free.      	1
	fantastic!!!	1
	!.the kindledx is fantastic!	1
	the pages turn at a good rate (i usually click next page when i reach the last line on the page), and it's really convenient to change text size.	1
	the read aloud feature is nice, but since it is a computer voice, there's no inflection with the text - it's kind of flat.	1
	other than that this is the best gift you could give an avid reader.      	1
	first time kindle owner--love it.i got the kindle dx as a gift as soon as it came out.	1
	after overcoming the initial guilt that i am another nail in the coffin of real books, i must admit that i love it.	1
	i would stay away from super techincal comments, because for me the kindle is not a gadget.	1
	i also must state upfront that i have not used some of the features others have commented on.	1
	instead i would focus on the reading experience:pluses--the best part about the kindle dx (and i guess any of the kindles) is the immediate delivery through wispernet.	1
	as soon as you are done with one book, you can order and start the next one.	1
	so many times, i would browse a bookstore, and postpone a purchase, till i read some reviews on amazon.com, only to get distracted and not buy/order a book (probably a sign of add, but who doesn't have add these days).	1
	or i would order a book online, only to forget what spiked my interest by the time it arrives.	1
	kindle dx solves that problem for you.--the screen is just the right size, it does render font beautifully and after a while you have forgotten you do not have an actual book.--i like being able to see all my library on my home screen and get to the last read page--you can adjust the font size and spacing, which is a nice feature.	1
	however, i have not figured out yet if you can adjust the contrast on the device--i woudl definitely make it a bit stronger if i could.	1
	things i am not so sure about:--i miss page numbers.	1
	instead of page numbers, there is a percentage 'bar' at the bottom of the screen.	1
	it is understandable why pagination will not work, given that you can adjust the font size.	1
	however, i find it a bit confusing to try and determine how much of the book i have read by percentages.	1
	it is probably just a matter of habit and eventually i will get used to it.	1
	--there are some interactive features that i have become so used to, that everytime i am holding a digital device i expect them by default.	1
	the kindle dx does not have them, though, and i find that lack a bit distrubing.	1
	for example, i kept looking for the equivalent of the 'back to top' button, that would take you to the beginning of the chapter, or i expected that the table of contents would be 'hyperlinked.'	1
	these may not be reasonable expectations but if we are going to an electronic book reader, should we make it more electronic?--i miss the ability to flip through pages, or go back to a certain chapter.	1
	while the kdx gives you the ability to search or highlight areas, it is not the same--i do not always know that i would want to go back to a spot, so i do not highlight it.	1
	not sure anything can be done about it.--archived items--i subscribed for the new york times, which is great.	1
	however, even if i delete an issue, it still remains in my archived items.	1
	i have not been able to find any information on wether or not archived items still use device memory, but even if they do not, my inherent need to keep things clean and organized makes me cringe everytime i see 20 archived items that i cannot clean.	1
	(probably a problem for a psychiatrist, not amazon.com)--the kindle library is good, but if you find a kindle book by an author you like you may be unpleasantly surprised to discover that older titles by the same author are not available.	1
	pride and prejudice however has at least five kindle editions?!?	1
	overall, i like the kindle dx.	1
	will it replace my love for real books--probably not.	1
	but it is a good ebook reader, that successds in balancing the benefits of the 'e-' with the old fashioned 'book' experience.   	1
	i 'upgraded' for the pdf support and larger screen.	1
	it actually works in thailand, out of the box!.i ordered my kindle with some trepidation, since i live in chiang mai (thailand).	1
	as a longtime software guy, i am well aware of the idea that 'pioneers are the ones with arrows sticking out of them.'	1
	i half-expected to be spending some of my time telling amazon of the problems i had encountered.	1
	still, i went ahead and gave it a try.	1
	my main motive was to reduce or eliminate the rather horrendous postage costs involved in shipping books from america to thailand.	1
	i've had this for a couple of weeks now, and, quite frankly, it performed as advertised, right out of the box.	1
	right now, i'm having fun reading 'king solomon's mines' --- the classic romantic adventure novel --- for the whopping price of $2.99 --- which works out to about 99 baht.	1
	that's a real good price, and the book is really enjoyable.	1
	not one complaint.	1
	satisfied customer.      	1
	feedback.your kindle dx is a very very nice products.	1
	i have 3 suggeestions for software improvements.	1
	1. when pdf documents are to be shown it is not possible to adjust font size and this section is greyed when ax button is pressed.	1
	i understand why, but i propose that it is possible to set a scale percentage i.e 92 or 96% instead.	1
	2. when next page on pdf documents are to be shown it might take 5-6 seconds before next page is shown.	1
	it would be nice if there were any way to see that next page button has been pressed.	1
	as it now you press one time, nothing happens and you press one more time and you skip 2 pages forward which is not what you intended.	1
	3. the battery level could be somewhat more distinct picture, so it is easier to see the actual battery level.	1
	as it is now you have to look twice to see what the battery level is.	1
	anyway, i still think it is a very nice product.	1

	1 book down 300,000+ to go.	1
	makes reading books so much easier.	1
	kindle for textbooks?	1
	the future of books.the kindle concept is wonderful.	1
	you can fit 1,000s of books with very little hard drive space.	1
	however, as someone who leads an academic life, i am looking for some upgrades.	1
	i want a kindle that has a screen as high and wide as a small open paperback.	1
	seeing only one page as a time is tough.	1
	when reading through academic textbooks, sometimes you need to refer back and forth between a few paragraphs to understand what is being said.	1
	the future of paperbacks?	1
	you bet.	1
	but before that happens, the price of the books need to come down.	1
	why buy an electronic version for the same price as the paper?	1
	i'd be willing to see some ads, like a magazine, if they would really drop the price.	1
	good luck, kindle.	1
	i hope you make it!      	1
	great expectations.	1
	a good improvement, but has some issues..	1
	kindle dx as very useful tool for those with sight problems.	1
	view from the tower.	1
	probably the best, leaves me wanting more.	1
	absolutely fabulous..	1
	i love my kindle,.i have macular degeneration and couldn't read most books.	1
	now i can enlarge the print and read comfortably.      	1
	immune surpressed.i bought the kindle for a friend who is immune-surpressed.	1
	she faced a period in isolation in a germ-free environment while she prepared for a bone marrow transplant.	1
	i thought the kindle would a 'safe read' for such a person instead of reading books her friends lent her, carrying who knows what germs.	1
	unfortunately, infection set in before she opened the box and she never made it to the transplant.	1
	i am now retuning the kindle.	1
	however, the fact remains, kindle is a good answer for the immune surpressed.	1
	by the way, i got her a kindle because i have one and love it.	1
	* video camera video review    * writtebill croninhartford, ct      	1
	very happy with the dx.i upgraded from the kindle 1 to the dx... very glad i did, the bigger screen does make a difference for me.	1
	and the wide screen mode works well when needed for displaying certain docs and pictures... mostly i don't need the wide screen but it's nice to have the capability.	1
	i agree with some of the other reviewers that when holding the reader with the right hand sometimes the next page button is not located high enough...center of gravity requires you to hold with one hand higher up than the button... but still.. it's a great reader.	1
	i've never had any problems with my kindle 1 and trust this will be just as reliable.	1
	even though it's bigger, it's still just as mobile, i take it when flying, waiting in the doctors office, to read in bed, even in the bathtub.      	1
	my new kindle.	1
	i just received my kindle-dx.	1
	from my computer i already have uploaded my manuscript into kindle for others to read.	1
	after a few adjustments, the pre-publication novel of 400 pages in pdf format presents itself extremely well.	1
	the book is quite readable after increasing the font size to #14 and converting the normal double-spacing of the manuscript to single space prior to uploading.	1
	the user's guide is difficult for me to follow, so i loaded kindle 2 for dummies, and this serves me much better.	1
	for example, it was in here i discovered one needs to keep the computer name of the manuscript's icon in all small letters for successful uploading into my kindle.	1
	i keep getting http error: 403 when i click on basic web, which brings the kindle into web traffic.	1
	hopefully this error should be solved soon.	1
	regarding appearance and readability, the kindle's casing should be a black color and textured like linen, not smooth and slippery.	1
	this will keep light from being reflected into the viewer's eyes and to permit easier long-term grasping and support of the kindle by the viewer's hands.	1
	all that being said, i love my kindle, which is bringing me kicking and screaming into the 21st century of book learning and enjoyment.	1
	giving up the feel and smell of paper and libraries saddens me.	1
	the next generation will learn from electronic hardware and software like kindle, and that is just the beginning.      	1
	i love my kindle dx.	1
	great for old eyes.i got my new dx over a week ago.	1
	i got it because i was having trouble reading the small fonts in the newspaper, mags, and books.	1
	the ability to change the font size up to 20pt has made reading enjoyable again.	1
	the user interface is intuitive and i highly recommend.      	1
	kindle dx.i thought i loved my kindle but i was mistaken!	1
	the kindle dx is fantastic!	1
	it is easier for me to hold and i like having no buttons or controls on the left side.	1
	it makes it so much easier to hold the kindle without accidentally changing the page i am reading.      	1
	kindle rocks!.i asked for the kindle dx for my birthday because i do alot of reading and tend to read many books at a given time.	1
	when i got my kindle dx i was overwhelmed at how totally cool it was.	1
	the reading screen is great and easy to read; easier for my older eyes than the printed page, really.	1
	i wasn't aware beforehand of how many newspapers, magazines and blogs you could also subscribe to.	1
	i can read the la times on it every morning.	1
	i also didn't realize how quickly books downloaded on the 3g networ.	1
	in less than a minute!	1
	very, very cool.	1
	i take it with me everywhere now and am especially excited to take it with me traveling.	1
	:)      	1
	kindle review.the kindle is awesome.	1
	i like the way you can download selections from amazon and get them almost instantly.	1
	i like that you can archive books and retrieve them at any time.	1
	i like the ease of reading with the kindle and the large screen.	1
	the overall size of the kindle is good also.	1
	i like that you can add your own notes and they will be saved.	1
	the search function is also good except it could be amplified.	1
	the kindle would be better if it were back-lighted so one could read all through the night.	1
	kindle would be improved if there were even more kindle-abled selections on amazon.	1
	typing is ok but the tiny keys can be hard to manage.	1
	i hope they keep improving this product.	1
	it rocks!      	1
	excellent tool for pilots.i have both a k2 and a dx.	1
	i find the k2 an easier device for plain brown wrapper reading.	1
	but for charts and use in the cockpit, the dx is a wonderful device.	1
	it displays approach plates and a/fds full size and crystal clear.	1
	charts can be downloaded [...] and they also have kneeboards for the dx.	1
	if you fly, get one.      	1
	kindle dx.i absolutely love this item; i procrastinated for some time before buying it.	1
	i flipped back and forth between the kindle 2 and the kindle dx because of the price difference, but finally settle on the kindle dx.	1
	i just liked the new features.      	1
	perfect gift - for me.......	1
	useful, fun, & well built!.i was worried when i purchased this device based on other reviews i may not be able tp read technical 2 column articles.	1
	after reciving my kindle dx the first thing i did was plug it into my pc and moved some pdf articles to the kindle's memory.	1
	it worked flawlessly, and i was able to easily read the article!	1
	i've been using it now for a couple weeks and i never leave home without it.	1
	i haven't had to resort to any printed articles so i think this will pay for itself in paper and ink costs before the end of the year.	1
	i'm a phd student and i recommend this reader to anyone who likes to read or is going to graduate school!the only con as far as i can tell is the 10 second timeout.	1
	it would be such an easy thing for them to make that optional as it does get annoying sometimes when it turns off while i am studying a page on a technical document which requires a lot of time to understand.      	1
	electronic elegance.avid reader, techno.	1
	guy, sterted with e-reader from sony, cool but too small; returned same got kindle 2, better but yet..................amazon was gracious enough, under 30 days to graduate me to the kindle dx, definitely 5 star.type is clear as a bell, light, great wi-fi, downloaded books best out there and some are free.........go figure.	1
	only suggestion,and i'm reaching would be a very small remote to turn pages, making the reader almost touch free; not sure why i'd mention this, never minded turning pages on a paper book.	1
	highly recommend, as stated earlier...electronic elegance      	1
	worth the upgrade!.	1
	i love my kindle dx!.this is my first kindle and i am completely in love with it!	1
	the dx is large enough that i can expand the text so that i don't need my reading glasses and there is still enough text on the screen to make reading enjoyable.	1
	i love that when i finish a book, i can order a new one and it literally arrives in less than a minute.	1
	i'm reading books i would never have bought in hard copy and finding new authors.	1
	i travel alot and used to pack several books; now i just put my kindle in my briefcase and i have an unlimited library.	1
	very cool.	1
	one thing i had to learn is that if i use my laptop's usb port to charge the kindle, that i needed to eject the kindle rather than just turn off my laptop.	1
	otherwise the kindle is locked up and i have to reattach to the laptop and eject.	1
	most people won't have this problem, i just need to conserve the precious hotel outlets.	1
	i find the larger kindle to be easy to carry (with the leather cover) and very easy to read.	1
	i've only had it a week and i don't ever want to read bound books again.	1
	i definitely recommend buying one!      	1
	great item.i just received my kindle dx and i love it.	1
	as to the cost.	1
	i have run out of bookshelves and would have had to get another for about the same price so i can't really complain about the price.	1
	the kindle comes fully registered and ready to go as soon as it arrives.	1
	the instruction manual doesn't explain everything so if you are a novice, you may have to call customer service for help.	1
	if you are gadget literate, you'll have no problem.	1
	the screen is great, the resolution very good.	1
	the 'text to speech' option is as good as most voice recognition software and it does make odd emphasis on some sentenances, but not too bad.	1
	the page refresh is fast and the download fast and seamless.	1
	it allows you to notate words, or sentances.	1
	this is a great option for my literary club so far, the kindle is well worth the money and i have yet to experience a problem.	1
	i would recommend it to anyone.	1
	hopefully soon you will be able to put school text books.       	1
	great customer service on return.	1
	kindle dx.received my kindle dx in july...kept the packaging because i wasn't sure how i would like reading a book on a machine.	1
	being of the 'old school' i really loved turning pages by hand.	1
	well, i've probably bought my last book in print.	1
	not only am i loving reading books on the kindle dx, i've also started to receive my daily newspaper.	1
	it's a treat.	1
	we've been on the road for the past 2 weeks & every day my paper has been downloaded in seconds -- even without a strong signal for the wireless -- it's amazing!	1
	i've been showing it off to everyone & those who knew about it, want it and those who hadn't heard about it want it, too!	1
	it's awesome.      	1
	i am so not regret with my purchase.	1
	grad student tired of carrying binders and buying file cabinets?.	1
	love it!	1
	this is the future.i am happy with the kindle dx.	1
	some people complained about the weight in the reviews.	1
	last book i read in its original paper form was kenn follett's pillars of the earth.	1
	thick book, great book, but the hardcover version is anything but easy to handle, especially whilst reading in bed... by comparison, the kindle is light and compact.	1
	does away with cumbersome books.	1
	ideal for people who like to read on the go.	1
	easy to tug into the luggage.	1
	holds tons of books, newspaper and mags.	1
	i love it!      	1
	not perfect, but darn close!	1
	(goodbye 3-ring binders).my primary reading material is technical -- either paperback books, many with more than 1000 pages, or pdf documents that i have printed as a 4-up / double sided pages stored in large 3-ring binders.	1
	this means i usually have about 5 to 10 pounds of printed matter to carry to and from work.	1
	i became excited when e-readers first began hitting the market.	1
	i picked up the sony prs-500, thinking i could use it in place of the tomes i now carry.	1
	unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations.	1
	the display was too small to read most pdfs.	1
	also, on larger documents with diagrams, it sometimes took 40 seconds or more to flip to the next page.	1
	after a month, the sony reader started collecting dust.	1
	when i heard about the kindle dx and its large display, i was eager to see if it would fit my needs.	1
	after the release, i started seeing some negative reviews of the device, specifically it's pdf features.	1
	so i hesitated, but finally decided to give it a try, as i could return it within 30 days.	1
	once i received the device, i was amazed!	1
	yes it has a few rough edges, but it is incredible and it far exceeds most of my expectations.	1
	first, the pdf viewer is not 'slow' as some have written.	1
	i have opened a 150mb pdf in about 5-6 seconds, and turning to the next page is about 1 second.	1
	this is about 40 times faster than the sony prs-500 for the same document.	1
	the display is exceptionally crisp and readable, even for 8.5x11 formatted pdfs.	1
	my eyesight is still fairly good and i am used to reading them printed 4-up (4 pages reduced to fit on one side of a single sheet of paper).	1
	the kindle dx lets me see the documents much larger than i am accustomed.	1
	the kindle dx display reproduces a full 8.5x11 page reduced to about 75 - 85% of its original size, depending on how much of the margins it is able to crop.	1
	on the downside, the dx doesn't have the ability to annotate a pdf, but this is something i rarely need.	1
	the dx lacks 'folders' to organize the hundreds of documents i carry on it, but by adding a keyword to the title of the document, you can quickly search for what is needed.	1
	the dx is missing support for hyperlinks in the table contents of a pdf, but this is not a deal breaker; you can still navigate to a specific page by selecting a menu option and typing the page number.	1
	the keyboard lacks a dedicated row of buttons for numbers, making page number entry cumbersome.	1
	my final gripe is that the leather case, an essential accessory, is not included.	1
	overall, i am very pleased with the kindle dx and i have no plans of returning this to amazon.  	1
	horrible, craptastic keyboard.	1
	performs exactly as described!.	1
	audio features for vision impaired customers.i purchased the kindle 2 for my mother who is rapidly loosing her eyesight from diabetes 7 months ago.	1
	i have had the dx in my purchase later section for 4 weeks, thinking i would upgrade for her (the larger screen would be easier for her to read while she still can).	1
	now i read that not all material is able to utilize the audio feature that she uses with each document on the dx?	1
	don't alienate a rapidly expanding client base of people who love to read but are loosing their eyesight by restricting this essential feature.      	1
	writing tablet for the real reader.	1
	like it but customer service is terrible.	1
	kindle swindle: thanks to drm kindle dx is defective by design.the amazon kindle e-book reader has drm that restricts users freedom to read.	1
	earlier this year (2009) amazon had a public relations nightmare when they remotely and automatically deleted electronic copies of the george orwell book 1984 off the kindles of their customers.	1
	imagine you buy a dvd at the video store only to come home and the store says we changed our mind we want you to return the dvd.	1
	they can't force you to return a physical copy of a product you buy but with drm on e-books can revoke your access to said content.	1
	in fact one student who was using the orwell book in class and keeping notes he made of the orwell book on his kindle found his copy of the book deleted without warning along with all his notes.	1
	apparently, this individual began suing amazon because of this.	1
	no company should have this type of power.	1
	it is said amazon did this because they got the rights to sell an electronic copy of the book from a company that did not have the rights to license the book to amazon -- rather than just removing the book from their kindle store to prevent future kindle book purchases and downloads of this book they removed the book off kindles completely without permission from the kindle owners.	1
	it doesn't matter if they automatically refunded the purchases of this book or not it was wrong for them to do this.	1
	e-book readers like the sony reader, amazon kindle (by the way amazon and barnes & noble are taking significant risks in getting into the consumer electronics/hardware business and making e-book readers as this is outside their traditional business areas) ans now barnes & noble nook are defective by design as they use drm.	1
	the kindle is a swindle as the nook is a crook.      	1
	great for professional use.the kindle is great for reading pdf-documents, even for profesional use.	1
	i use it to present documents to my clients.      	1
	global kindle.wayhay - my 50th birthday today and i received the global kindle dx.	1
	after initial teething problems such as  1. wondering whether they had actually sent me a global edition or a us edition as the      a. mains plug was us and      b. there was nothing on the packing to indicated whether it was the global edition or not and     c. there was an ominious command to 'plug it into a us mains supply' in the quick start manual that accompanies the product and     d. when i eventually got the courage to believe it was ok and plugged it in there was no amber light or lightening symbol on the top right of the screen as there 'should' have been.	1
	2. getting used to the damm 5 way 'square' control which never appears to do what you want it to do 3. feeling a bit annoyed that you can't turn justification off i like the product!it has a nice feel, downloading the books was really easy and i didn't have to be tied to the desk or awaiting the postman, using the speech enabled text was wonderful once my eyes got tired, and the serif font used was easy on my eyes.	1
	the text is clear and crisp and i could even see it when the sun shone hard through our windows.	1
	registration was easy and access to my wish list fairly easy once i got command of that damm 5 way control.	1
	it did do a few odd things though - like going back to the start of the manual and continually highlighting text instead of moving the cursor - but those are due (i think) to my initial difficulties with the 5 way control - no doubt i'll get the knack soon!.	1
	haven't tried pdfs on it yet though!      	1
	it's g-r-r-r-e-a-t!.	1
	my library in the palm of my hand, reads to me.things i love:* instant access to books* screen size* clarity of text* auto rotation between portrait and landscape* text-to-speech -- i use this function a lot as it seems to help me remember what i read better* the number of books i can store on this kindle* the diverse range of books, especially foreign language and free books* weight -- virtually none!	1
	i think what a wonderful tool this would have been when i was in a university student.	1
	hold all my books for all my classes in this device.	1
	just the thought of it is heavenly!	1
	* international access -- i travel a lot!	1
	* ease of use -- is so intuitive that it doesn't come with an instruction booklet would be better if ...* needs a lock-buttons button -- sometimes when i'm commuting, a button gets bumped and stops the text-to-speech i'm listening to or changes to another screen, etc.	1
	* needs a better battery or ... better yet ... solar power* needs a temp toggle-switch light for the buttons* needs optional, toggle-switch backlighting for reading in low light situationsnote: as a solution to reading in low light situations, a colleague of mine has loaded kindle for pc on his netbook and reads from it while the family is watching tv, etc.	1
	* needs a color version* needs a child-proof kiddie version* owner should have the option to lock out their own kindle.	1
	i lost my first kindle and would have liked to lock it so no futher books could be added to it without my permission.	1
	this would have the added bonus of making it no more than a paperweight.	1
	it would increase the impetus for people who find a lost kindle to return it to amazon and since each kindle is registered to a person, amazon could mail it back to me.	1
	it would be nice if amazon set up a 'lost kindle return' spot on the site so anyone finding a kindle could mail it back and then amazon could try to return it to the original owner.	1
	i'm sure the owner would pay the postage.	1
	despite all the recommendations i made, i love it.	1
	my colleague was looking at it enviously and comparing it to the 6' version he has and the liquid paper screen on this version is decidedly better.	1
	it makes reading in low light situations easier, because of the contrast and clarity.	1
	this is the best investment for my suitcase, my back and my life.	1
	i don't have to lug around heavy books and i don't have to try to decide which book to bring on the plane -- just bring them all!	1
	kindle dx global.i have been using my kindle dx extensively for several weeks now.	1
	"i am using it for both work, printing documents to pdf for the kindle, and reading newspapers and several books and my findings to date are: general:-	the screen is similar to a semi-gloss magazine - easy to read-	about the size and weight of a 'trade' size paperback."	1
	"definitely lighter than my hardbacks eg compare marcus buckingham 'go put your strengths to work' the good-	large page size is great."	1
	pdf docs which don't resize can easily be read.	1
	"much prefer it to the smaller kindle-	ergonomics are good:	coffee one hand - kindle the other - regardless of the book	in bed sitting up, i prop it up on my knees and can read and write in my journal (studying) without putting down/picking up-	love the dictionary even if it is american english."	1
	"great addition-	amazon selection of books-	kindle book store is great v but be warned it is too easy to order books!"	1
	":-)-	no problem with battery life with wireless off.-	good download experience to date areas for improvement-	i put a lot of documents on the kindle dx."	1
	i store them (via usb) in directories on the kindle's memory but there is no browse function that reflects the directories.	1
	the problem with this that i already have 3 pages of documents and navigation is becoming a problem.	1
	"i'd like to see this future updates.-	format support."	1
	documents in .prc format are the same as .mobi.	1
	"i have to rename them all the time instead of the kindle looking at the format.adobe drm files not supported-	ebooks cost."	1
	i have been looking to replace some of my books with ebooks.	1
	many of the hardback management or personal development books are cheaper in hardback than electronic.	1
	everyone i have demonstrated the dx too has been impressed.	1
	it is however expensive for the limited functions it does.	1
	dx kindle.as some one who travels a lot an brings 3-5 books with me this is great for traveling.however size is not as convenient as a paperbook.	1
	it is also heavier than expected or desired.      	1
	wonderful hardware, but uk service is a bit second class..hi, i write this as a uk owner of the kindle dx, and i'd definitely recommend one: the screen is fantastic, just superb, it really looks like paper and you can read for hours (as i have done) with no eye strain.	1
	the best e-ink screen by far i have ever seen.	1
	there is the page change black/white flicker you get with all e-ink screens, but on the dx, this is sub-second - compare this to the nook and any sony reader and you'll quickly see the differences.	1
	there have been complaints about the keyboard, but i find it very usable, and having to access numbers through an alt key is not too bad - i tend to navigate via the toc or text searches where you need number access far less.	1
	the built-in dictionary is a great boon too, and i appreciate not having to have the device plugged into a computer to download books.	1
	the amazon leather case (unfortunately an extra) looks the part too - well made, perfect fit, magnetic closing and, because the fastening is along the spine, there are no tacky straps or bars covering your kindle.	1
	classy.	1
	occasionally during downloads, the spinning busy wheel stops but the screen doesn't update for 5-10 seconds so the ui could be improved here a bit, but this could be fixed by a software update (that i presume comes over the air).	1
	my gripe is with the uk-specific parts, and i drop a star for this: no uk plug adaptor is supplied, which is a touch half-hearted, the experimental browser doesn't work in the uk, you can't subscribe to blogs in the uk (perhaps no big loss), but worst of all, and this is very unlike amazon, you get no pictures in newspapers and magazines!	1
	come on, amazon, this isn't right, especially as the kindle includes screen savers of various authors, a nice touch, showing off how stunning the screen is.	1
	some of the book covers are a bit dull when you download the book and not like the thumbnails you see in the kindle store.	1
	so, to summarise: superb hardware, easy to use, a single-purpose tool that does just what it should, but uk buyers are treated as second class citizens and this needs to change.      	1
	kindle dx 9.7' is a bit too heavy.	1
	pluses & minuses.	1
	my favorite piece of technology.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	great reader.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	reader.after serious thought, i elected to purchase a kindle dx.	1
	i read 75 -100 books a year and hoped i would like it.	1
	happy to report i couldn't be more pleased.	1
	my interests are varied from the classics to current economic times.	1
	the ease of selection and readability is outstanding.	1
	glare bothers me, and i find reading the kindle is easier on my eyes than reading a book.	1
	am like a kid in a candy store.	1
	feel like i have the world at my fingertips.	1
	thank you for this wonderful device.         	1
	excellent kindle dx.	1
	kindle dx, the perfectly sized reader.to see the entire review with pictures, search google with 'pingjeffgreene kindle'.	1
	i recently took the plunge and bought the kindle dx (global wireless) from amazon.	1
	most of the books i read are typically 1000 pg technical reference type books that just take up too much room and are cumbersome to haul back and forth from work to home.	1
	for me, the benefit is having pretty much all of my reading material on a device that is no larger than a national geographic magazine.	1
	i can search a keyword or phrase in 1 book or all of my books at the same time.	1
	this technology could be a huge benefit for college students, business travelers, or just anyone with too many books and not enough space(like me).	1
	the hardwareabout 1 month after pre-ordering the kindle dx (global wireless), a small little box arrived in the mail.	1
	inside the little box are only 3 things (kindle dx, usb/power cord, user manual) now that i've had the kindle dx for a couple weeks i thought i would share some of my own findings: * download time for the local newspaper (the news & observer)....about 1 min.	1
	noticed that the daily and the sunday paper are both $.50....bonus!	1
	* download timer for a larger 1000+ page book with diagrams, etc....(cisco press) ....about 10 min.	1
	i should note that i purchased the cisco press as i was leaving for work.	1
	the kindle dx was on the passenger car seat downloading while commuting to work.	1
	about 10 min into my commute i looked down and saw the new book.	1
	* download time for a small 400+ page book was only 30 seconds.....the art of war, by sun tzu.	1
	* reading pdf files is a snap.	1
	just drag the pdf file via usb from your pc to kindle.	1
	or you can email a pdf file to your kindle for a fee....$.15 per megabyte while inside the u.s. wireless coverage, $.99 per megabyte outside the u.s. password protected pdf files are not supported.	1
	you can rotate the kindle to view the pdf file or any page horizontally if you like.	1
	this seems especially helpful if you are reading diagrams, flowcharts, etc...  * text-to-speech function: i would give this an ok, though i probably won't use it much.	1
	the voice is not like the narrated voice of an audio book.	1
	the voice is similar to that of the turn-by-turn directions you may have on your gps unit in your car.	1
	it's kind of a choppy,mechanical sound, that will sometimes mispronounce words from time to time....but it's just fine if you're just wanting to get the gist of a newspaper article.	1
	* dictionary: awesome!	1
	just put the cursor in front of the word, and the kindle displays the definition instantly at the bottom of the page.	1
	* weight: some people say the kindle dx is heavy.	1
	it's not heavy...certainly not heavier than a book.	1
	18.9 ounces.	1
	* bookmarks/notes: very easy to add and search on for later reference.	1
	* kindle dx automatically bookmarks your last page.	1
	you can power off, power on, and pick up right where you left off.	1
	* search function: locally, kindle store, google, wiki, dictionary, notes.	1
	simply start typing a word or phrase and a box pops up at the bottom of the screen.	1
	click search within any of the above sections and a list of results appears.	1
	* samples: you can get a sample download of a book/newspaper, etc for free to make sure it is what you want before buying.	1
	* accessing the web: this function is still in experimental stages, and really only useful on websites with mostly text based content.	1
	flash animations, etc are not supported and do not show up.	1
	this will work ok in a pinch, but your browsing will be better on your laptop or smartphone.	1
	overall, i would give the kindle dx 4 out of 5 stars.	1
	the price at $489 from amazon is pretty steep.	1
	the browser needs some work.	1
	hopefully in the future, the browser will include flash animation, so most websites will not be so cumbersome.	1
	i can't really say anything negative.	1
	the screen resolution has amazing clarity.	1
	all of the search functions, menu changes, and page turns are very responsive.      	1
	kindle dx.	1
	i love my kindle dx!!!.	1
	the kindle dx is easy to use, easy to read and fast.	1
	it turns pages faster than i can!	1
	i love it.	1
	i got the tablet style case and the m-edge lamp that attaches inside the case.	1
	both are great accessories.	1
	i prop my kindle dx on my lap in bed at night and read with the m-edge lamp (plenty of light to read by)instead of the nightstand lamp that used to bother my husband.	1
	it's great!	1
	i was not download savy, but this method is just too easy to screw up.	1
	can you click on 'buy'?	1
	you can have a good book in less than two minutes, without even leaving the couch!	1
	i have purchased 9!	1
	books since christmas.	1
	this is the very best gift my husband has ever picked for me -- it is like having my own bookstore!	1
	the ladies in my book club loved it too when i showed it off.	1
	also, the page is easier to read than paper- no tired eyes even when i read for hours at a time.	1
	the mouse button (for moving the cursor in four directions and clicking) works logically with the pull down menus.	1
	the dx screen is big enough to hold a page-worth for me, even though i am a very fast reader.	1
	i am happier with this purchase/ gift than with anything our family has bought in a long time.	1
	definitely worth it!        	1
	new to kindle.this was my first kindle and so far i find it to be exactly what was promised.	1
	it would be nice to have the ability to customize folders to store books so i could group genres and the i'm not sure about trying to read a newspaper in a book format.	1
	however the luxury of being able to carry my books and the ease of reading makes it worth it.      	1
	simpicity.i love my kindle dx.	1
	the beauty of this device and the smaller kindle for that matter is simplicity.	1
	first it replaces the bulk of holding a book open with tense thumbs from the binding pull, especially a large thick novel or technical manual.	1
	ever try to hold a book open and turn the page with one hand while eating or enjoying that morning cup of coffee?	1
	with the kindle , no problem, all you need is one finger to press next page.	1
	secondly the crisp black screen ink against the soft neutral background (no back light) gives an amazingly clear contrast without assaulting your eyes and the ability to increase or decrease text size will satisfy young or old eyes.	1
	thirdly the battery life on the kindle lasts a long time between charges, which is a very important bonus.	1
	i hate most portable electronic devices because they suck battery life so quickly.	1
	i can go almost two weeks without even thinking about a charge(wireless off).	1
	the larger screen on the kindle dx is the perfect size for me (newspapers and native pdf file support) although i could see how some people would dislike the extra weight.	1
	this will not fit into your purse ladies.	1
	my wife has the smaller kindle and does not like the larger size or the extra weight but i am pressing the next page button half as many times as she and appreciate the extra real estate.	1
	if you just read books then buy the kindle 2. if you will be reading magazines or newspapers in addition to books and small footprint portability is not so critical than buy the dx.	1
	i do my book downloading from my computer thereby bypassing having to use the kindle keyboard and joystick which is probably my least favorite part of the product experience.	1
	most of your time on this device will be spent reading so no big deal.	1
	my only other knock would be the dx is somewhat on the pricey side.	1
	i would recommend ponying up another $[...] bucks and buying the amazon kindle dx black cover which really enhances the feel and look of the product.	1
	it snaps in nicely and holds the device secure, just be careful to always open it from the front only.	1
	no thank you apple ipad or nook.	1
	amazon has a winner with both kindle models and i hope they continue to adhere to the kiss method.	1
	no distractions, just read and enjoy your books.	1
	fabulous.i got my kindle dx for christmas 2009 after shopping and going on line and viewing everything on the market.	1
	my husband and daughters also shopped for a device for me: we travel a lot and i get the shakes when i don't have good reading material on hand!	1
	when i first saw the kindle i thought it was too big and too heavy.	1
	not so.	1
	it is so easy on my eyes and after working on a computer all day i wondered if viewing another computer-like screen would work.	1
	i am happy to report i can read for hours and my eyes don't get tired.	1
	oh, get a cover for it.	1
	you don't want to put your new baby at risk.	1
	i understand amazon offers excellent support but i don't want to test that.      	1
	easy reader.	1

	awesome.have used the dictionary at least 5 times during my present reading, i already figured out how to bookmark, and also how to keep the text  vertical on the screedn.	1
	i have taken it with me on the plane, i love it, will never read a huge hard copy thick book again unless it is on kindle.      	1

	the display is large and the ability to adjust the size of text is an added bonus.	1
	rotating text is fabulous, from portrait to landscape in split seconds.	1
	i enjoy the dictionary that is available for use while reading, so when you hit those words that you just don't understand you can look them up, or rather the kindle looks them up.	1
	brilliant!	1

	i love my kindle dx.	1
	it's a whole new day!!!.amazing.	1
	huge screen.	1
	very easy to use.	1
	i bought the kindle so that i could have immediate access to newspapers, but wondered about how i would be able to scan a page of the paper.	1
	the system of very short beginning excerpts per article, by section, works great.	1
	but beyond that, having instant access to any book is incredible.	1
	being able to adjust type size is a fantastic feature and the way the screen is designed makes legibility much better than reading a book directly.	1
	battery lasts a long time too.	1
	it is definetly a wow!      	1
	awesome.	1
	still enjoying my kindle dx.	1

	great kindle.	1
	perfect.	1
	can't bear to be without.	1
	my 2nd kindle.	1
	kindle snob!.although i felt it was somewhat pricey, i love my new kindle.	1
	so much so that i may never buy another (traditional) book!	1
	my family calls me a kindle snob !	1
	books download with lightening speed and are less expensive than 'real books'.	1
	some books are even free !i thought i might have trouble getting used to holding a kindle as it has a very different feel from a bound book, but that didn't happen.	1
	and i'll never again lose my page; no more scraps of paper to hold my place.	1
	kindle does that, too.	1
	and the built-in dictionary -- wow!	1
	it's a great device. 	1
	my new toy.i didn't realize how much i needed a kindle dx - need as in able to read more than 2 books at once with ease, significant savings in hardback copies and no need to accumulate boxes and boxes of books no one wanted (i can't recycle them!)	1
	my husband agrees that the kindle is an investment, it didn't take much convincing.thank you amazon.	1
	now i only need service in switzerland when i travel to see my grandchildren.	1
	i am there now and miss the store, etc.	1
	review of kindle.i am so in love with my kindle.	1
	it was given to me as an anniversary present and i am throughly enjoy ordering and reading books on it.	1
	i am sorry that i didn't get one sooner as i had been hearing about them for quite some time.	1
	i very much prefer to read from the kindle than from  books.      	1
	kindle.i love my kindle.	1
	i had been a member of 2 book clubs, but my kindle has made my memberships obsolete.	1
	the prices for books in the kindle store are extremely competitive.	1
	also kindle has the advantage of storing books in a tiny space (the device)-no more clutter of my library.	1
	technologically the kindle is also great.	1
	when i first used the product, i would inadvertently reach to turn the page.	1
	this electronic reader is awesome.	1
	i would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves reading.	1
	i look forward to kindle improving pdf compatibility and magazine and newsprint formatting.      	1
	great things do come in small packages!.i've had my kindledx for over a month now and i think it is one of the best purchases that i have ever made.	1
	it is easy to use and so thin that it fits in my purse so i take it everywhere with me.	1
	i like the feature that lets you change the font size, as this lets me use it without my glasses on.	1
	the voice that is used on the feature of having it in an audio format is like a robot voice, kinda creepy.	1
	i only used that once and will probably never use it again.	1
	i like tha fact that it keeps your place in the book every time you log off, very handy.	1
	i wish it had a back light though and also a feature where you could mark a book as already read, but all in all it is a great product.      	1
	kindle dx.love it, love it,  i travel allot for business and this is a way to carry my books with out the added weight.	1
	also, i can download pdf files from work and use them on the road.pollyanna      	1
	update suggestions.wonderful machine and will eventually replace books.ability to enlarge text important for defective or aging vision.update:color screen instead of b&w.	1
	;        use of sd chip to enlarge memory or make specific libraries allowing better cataloging.      	1
	richards kindle.i love my kindle.	1
	ive gone from two books a year to - i have read 6 books since i purchased my kindle about 1 per week.	1
	keep it next to my recliner chair and use it every day.	1
	richard healey      	1
	kindle size.i originally ordered the fullsize kindle, but it was too heavy for me.	1
	i've had a stroke and one of the benefits of kindle is that it weighs less than most books, plus i don't have to try to hold the binding together when turning pages.	1
	another big thing for me is that i have some visual issues from the stroke, though cognitively i'm fine.	1
	the kindle will 'read to me' when i find myself stumbling over words.	1
	i can see that if this was marketed to the right sector, this would be huge for stroke or neurological problems.	1
	my neurologist was fascinated by it and i'm pretty sure there will be more kindle sales coming from that direction.	1
	i had to return the big one, of course and amazon was very polite and helpful.	1
	the only downside, which i anticipated, is the skimpy graphics, meaning that only text-driven material is appropriate.	1
	charts and graphs become meaningless on the relatively small screen.      	1
	easier to read with kindle.	1
	need folders.great product.	1
	needs some key improvements- folders- ability to change screen savers- more testing on the browser -- struggles with may pages and gets confused between desktop and basic mode sometimes.- if you move items into subfolders, sometimes they appear twice.	1
	only way to fix is remove everything to your pc, disconnect, then reconnect and put everything back.- for pictures it should save the grey scale conversions so it is faster the second time around instead of reconverting to display everytime.	1
	other than that, this is an awesome product.	1
	it gets you into reading again and makes reading easier than books.	1
	you don't have to decide what heavy books to lug around, you can take them all and decide when you turn it on.	1
	the next evolution needs to be color.	1
	that would open up selling comics (among other things) to this device for a more reasonable price and make them relevant again instead of just for 30 somethings who will pay $4 per and are chasing their missed youth experiences.      	1
	expected more for $500!.i bought the kindle thinking that i can upload all my pdfs, word and http files for reading.	1
	however all the formats advertised will not work unless it is converted first except pdf.	1
	the native pdf reader has no functionalities none!	1
	it is literally a display.	1
	you can't even change the font size!	1
	the mp3 player does not display the song playing, no play list feature, can not choose a particular song.	1
	the only controls are play/stop & forward???	1
	the speed is slow and the premium is too high over the standard 6' model.	1
	i am returning it hoping next generation will be more robust like an iphone or blackberry.	1
	the feel and display quality is excellent!	1
	if you read lots of e-books and use the news services they offer the 6' version would be a good buy.	1
	great reader with one limitation.to begin with, i really do like the device.	1
	it is much bigger and heavier than you would expect out of an ebook reader, which i consider to be a plus, especially if you have trouble reading the smaller fonts of a paperback.	1
	it tracks the percentage complete of the book you're reading instead of the page numbers, which is different but fine.	1
	the major drawback is book availability from amazon.	1
	i have more niche tastes than general pop fiction and non-fiction, and i have a difficult time finding the books i read, including some i would definitely expect to be available, such as atlas shrugged, the wheel of time series, and several hugo and nebula winners.	1
	the saving grace is the on-board pdf support, allowing you to transfer pdf ebooks you may have onto the device (this is also a great way of avoiding drm issues you may be concerned with).	1
	if you travel frequently, this is a great buy so you do not have to toil your collection around.	1
	and the convenience of downloading a book instead of visiting a store cannot be overstated; this is especially true for more impulsive readers like myself who may want to read 3 books on a beach vacation, but may not know what should be the 2nd and 3rd book before leaving.	1
	two more minor annoyances are the poor ebook store interface on the device and the random switching from portrait to landscape views when you turn the book to the side--this feature is the exact same as on the ipod which i also hate there, just so you know--but neither of these are big enough drawbacks to keep you from buying.	1
	all in all, i would recommend it.      	1
	an excellent sequel.	1
	great convenience for print media.our new kindle dx is a great way to gather selected books and magazines to read and not have the clutter to deal with afterward, which means that you download (fast as promised, driving down the interstate or sitting at home) titles you don't want kept in your library.	1
	things we thought it would do but doesn't:  audio.	1
	kindle will read to you, but only certain titles (seems to be a permission problem) and the software still doesn't work smoothly (no pauses at the end of chapters, for example.)	1
	audiobooks are only available through a monthly subscription from one site.        	1
	new toy.i waited until this generation came out because of certain problems with the original, i.e.	1
	page turn, etc.	1
	and for the larger size.	1
	i wasn't disappointed.	1
	i like the ability to do portrait or landscape and i like the 'look'.	1
	i also like the the simple web browsing, although there are a few bugs there.	1
	time will tell and hopefully they continue the service.	1
	it's great for those of us in the sticks with no affordable data plan on phones.	1
	even in the slow download, it works well with the books.	1
	unit is slightly heavier than i would like - no more than a book, but the center of gravity is different and causes hand strain.	1
	i have to be careful to prop or i get really sore forearm... my only issue is that it will sometimes reset itself and i have to sync to redownload...  guess i'll have to check the lists and see what's up with that.      	1
	dx kindle.very good product however wish very much you would have kept left side paging ability.	1
	this even though i am right handed because i often use dx while eating in which case right hand occupied either with cutlery or a finger food so would like paging also on left and actually prefer paging with my left hand at all times.	1
	placing the on/off switch on the face, perhaps top area of dx, would be a whopping physical improvement.	1
	greatest improvement would be software which would permit organizing into directories and changing id of book authors with surnames first then given names as all libraries do and method almost all avid readers recall and search for items in their collections.      	1
	good fit for me.i recently purchased a kindle 2 for my mom for mother's day, so i had an opportunity to look at hers before making my own decision on what to purchase.	1
	i did not like the size of the screen on the kindle 2, so i decided if a kindle were to fit me, it would need to be the dx.	1
	i want to split this review up into two different sections.	1
	the first will review the hardware and native features of the dx and the other will review the kindle software and content.	1
	hardware: screen:  i love the large screen of the kindle.	1
	it's about the size of a hardcover book and allows me to read enough content without feeling like i'm turning the page all the time.	1
	as for the screen rotation, i found i do not like the auto rotate feature.	1
	because i lay down to read, it kept turning the text sideways.	1
	fortunately you can lock it in place, and there it stays.	1
	maybe i'll change that if i decide to subscribe to a newspaper, but i have yet to see a need for landscape viewing yet.	1
	weight:  the dx is a little heavier than i would prefer it, but it's not too big of an issue.	1
	i usually read sitting or lying down anyway.	1
	speed:  the dx is still a little too slow in my opinion, and this is very noticeable when you try to do any of the 'experimental' items like basic web browsing.	1
	accessing the kindle store also seems to take a while to load and i don't think it's because of the wireless.	1
	battery:  as for battery life, i'm finding that i get a few days to maybe a week.	1
	i'm definitely not able to get the 2 weeks that some report on the k2.	1
	i also use it almost every day and sometimes for several hours in a day.	1
	radios:  i'm not sure if it's the magnets in the amazon kindle cover i have, but my coverage is a little weird.	1
	in my bedroom i'll go from 2 bars to none and i think that may be draining the batteries quicker than i'd like it to.	1
	i would also prefer the dx to have a built in wireless radio rather than rely solely on the cellular and the ability to turn either radio off individually.	1
	buttons:  i do like the idea of having the previous and next page on both sides of the device.	1
	when i first got the dx and was getting used to reading on it, i found myself trying to hit a button on the left side that wasn't there at times.	1
	pdf's:  unfortunately i cannot review this as i just haven't found the need to put a pdf on here yet.	1
	kindle software/content: software:  i'm hoping they are working on software updates since they probably aren't releasing a new kindle for at least a year.	1
	my biggest complaints are the lack of folders and the inability to customize certain portions of the kindle.	1
	i should be able to change the sleep timer on the kindle, for instance.	1
	we should be able to upload our own and delete the factory installed screen saver pictures as well.	1
	i would also prefer an extra warning when you delete your purchased content from the kindle.	1
	i accidentally deleted a book i was reading rather than a blog download.	1
	i wasn't able to find a way to re-download this content directly from the kindle.	1
	luckily i was near my computer so i was able to send it again, but i would not have been happy if i was somewhere where i didn't have a computer and i wanted to read.	1
	fortunately these are all software improvements and can easily be addressed.	1
	hopefully they will be in the near future.	1
	content:  i'm glad that there are now 300,000 titles to download, but there still needs to be a lot of additions.	1
	i find more books that aren't available than are right now.	1
	i don't know if it's because publishers are too slow to adopt the format, or if that it just takes too long for the content to be digitized, but i really hope that publishers realize that digital content is where they need to be focusing more of their energy.	1
	final thoughts: after i bought my dx and i was able to take it to my mom's to compare it side by side to the k2.	1
	the dx is the right size kindle for me.	1
	that being said, my mom and girlfriend both said they prefer the size of the k2 to put in their purses to take with them.	1
	i am glad i made this purchase, although i would prefer it to be a little cheaper.	1
	i find myself reading more than i have in years, and that's a good thing for my mind and probably not so great for my wallet.      	1
	steve's kindle dx.i love this product and i never leave home without it.	1
	i had a kindle 1 and this has numerous improvements, including reducing the buttons.	1
	they still have not solved the button issue as it is too difficult to hold the unit without unintentionally depressing the buttons, particularly the home button.	1
	the joy stick navigation is really great!      	1
	kindle dx rocks!.i am ecstatic over my kindle dx.	1
	it is all i hoped it would be, and more.	1
	i love the fact that downloads are so fast.	1
	the user's guide that comes on it makes learning the features a breeze.	1
	thanks amazon for a great product.	1
	i highly recommend it.      	1
	satisfied but looking forward to software improvements.in my initial review of the kindle dx i rated it 3 stars, but am revising that upward to 4 stars as i have used it more.	1
	this is primarily due to the excellent readability of the screen and the sheer utility of the device.	1
	i had not bought a kindle previously because of lack of true pdf support and returned a sony reader because of very poor pdf support.	1
	one of my key reasons for wanting the dx was the promised pdf support.	1
	my impressions so far:1.  the software puts kindle format reading ahead of pdf, mp3, and browser support.	1
	i am fine with that to start, but hope amazon will put the resources behind software updates to improve the dx for these other data types.2.	1
	the pdf support is servicable, but has room for improvement.	1
	for pdf articles it does a great job.	1
	for pdf books downloaded from the web (google books or internet archive), will occasionally get 'some elements on this page could not be displayed' messages.	1
	these pages take extra long time to render.	1
	hopefully, amazon will identify the sources of these 'elements' and improve the pdf rendering.	1
	as stated in other reviews, the kindle dx does not support pdf index and other features, which is not ideal for book-length pdfs.	1
	also, in general loading and turning pages in pdf is somewhat slower than the book formats.3.	1
	pdf cropping of white space is inconsistent.	1
	on clean pdf articles, it works great.	1
	on scanned books from the web in general will not work (i assume it is interpreting the noise lines near the edge as a real feature).	1
	a zoom would be helpful here with no loss of content.	1
	4.  it is nice and convenient to have audio capability built in, eliminating the need to carry a separate audio player.	1
	however, the experimental version included is so rudimentary it is barely usable.	1
	the mp3's sound nice (thru headphones, marginal thru speakers).	1
	there are play, stop, and forward buttons, but they forgot the back button.	1
	one needs to let the last song play out before it will loop back to the beginning.	1
	add to this you cannot view what mp3's are on the machine (except by using your computer in usb mode) nor set the play order.	1
	hopefully amazon will create some kind of audio player to create at least basic functionality.5.	1
	keyboard buttons could have been a little bigger and more spread out in the same space on the bottom of the dx.	1
	that would have helped a lot.	1
	typing into webpages is somewhat painful.	1
	i consider this a lesser sin for this generation of book reader, but would like to see something better in future generations.6.	1
	some kind of foldering system would be nice.	1
	at this point i have loaded ~100 files, which take 7 pages on the home screen to go thru.	1
	again, i hope amazon puts the resources behind improving the software.	1
	in the future, i can imagine a kindle size device that is a great book reader that you can read in bed, on an airplane, or just generally traveling about.	1
	it will have an audio player.	1
	it will be in color, providing full support to color books and pdf.	1
	it will also likely include a web browser (though how web access is paid for is separate issue).	1
	nothing like this exists on the market today (net books and tablets just are not there yet either).	1
	hopefully someone will see this as a vision for a product that will displace all current book readers.	1
	the dx is a step in that direction, and has some really nice characteristics-excellent screen rendering, very long battery life (4 days and still have half the initial charge), and portability.	1
	these are the reasons that justify to me purchasing the kindle dx over a netbook or tablet for reading books and pdfs.	1
	i think the vision above is a few years away, and the kindle dx can provide a lot of value now, so i am overall happy with my purchase.	1
	i hope amazon will make me even happier over time by software improvements.  	1
	perfect if it had folders.	1
	exactly as advertized.	1
	kindle dx: great!.	1
	love my kindle.	1
	such a gem!.	1
	delighted with my dx!.	1
	i can read again.	1
	kindle dx review.i have been quite happy with  my kindle.	1
	i have always loved to read but have recently developed some vision problems which make it difficult to read smaller print.	1
	the ability to change the font size has been wonderful.        	1
	great for reading!	1
	!.	1
	make a great product even better.background and the challenge:  my wife and i are retired and we travel  and spend months away from home.	1
	we have an large collection of books and its a chore to choose what to take and lug them around.	1
	solution:  a friend of mine bought his son a kindle 2 for college graduation and was telling me about its features.	1
	among them were the great screen, ease of use, storage capacity, portability, and that one account can have multiple kindles assigned to it.	1
	this last permits one account to buy a book and use it on more than one device simultaneously.	1
	this last feature was the key.	1
	my wife and i bought two kindle dxs, and we have downloaded many of the books we have in our paper library.	1
	we now have these books no matter where we are, easy to carry, delightfull to use and can use them at the same time.	1
	(when we return home we'll donate all of the paper books we have now purchased on amazon to the public library.)	1
	we also each have an iphone and we have downloaded the books to the iphones on the theory that you never know where you will be stuck and get bored.	1
	all these devices sync with each other so losing your place isn't a problem.	1
	if you like audible audio books, the kindle can play them.	1
	since we have an audible account, this was an unexpected bonus.	1
	we would purchase the kindle dxs over again.	1
	based on our usage there are some suggestions we would make to amazon to make this great product even better.	1
	first, the memory on the kindle should be bigger, at least 16 or 32 gb.	1
	the kindle can play audible books; but the files sizes are far larger for audio files than books.	1
	second, the kindle will play mp3 files.	1
	expand the file types playable to other main formats, e.g., wma and aac; incorporate a true, high quality audio 'mp3' player with all of its features in the kindle; and put an am/fm tuner in it.	1
	third, we spend a lot of time in a location just outside of the range of any wireless service, but do have a wireless internet connection.	1
	we can use the wifi capability of our iphone to connect to the kindle store.	1
	but i have to use the computer to download books to then copy over to the kindle's themselves.	1
	make the wireless capability in the kindle like the iphone, i.e., if a wifi network is available you can choose to use that instead of the e/3g cellular network capability?	1
	fourth, battery life is good, but it could be better.	1
	fifth, make the software so that it can download multiple books at a time all for the same kindle device.        	1
	kindle dx.bought this kindle because my husband has early dementia and is unable to read books to himself any more.	1
	the text-to-speech feature works well most of the time, but when reading a book with a lot of 'he said/she said' commentary (like robert b parker books), the end of one sentence gets attached to the beginning of the next, there is no sound break between chapters, and if chapters are numbered, the chapter number is read as the first word of the chapter dialogue.	1
	these glitches can be confusing, but the reading feature works well and suited my purpose very well.	1
	sound is adequate for car listening.	1
	especially enjoy having the ability to have magazine articles read as well as books and control the speed that text is read.         	1
	upgraded and happy.i upgraded from the 2nd gen kindle and really love the larger screen and the newer features of the dx.	1
	text to speech feature is one of my favorites.	1
	could i have gotten by with my 2nd gen and saved the money?	1
	yes, but i am enjoying the dx much more.	1
	the only drawback is the size if you want to carry it in a handbag.	1
	2nd gen, even with a cover on was about the size of a larger paperback.	1
	the dx, while thin still takes up quite a bit of real estate in a handbag or tote.	1
	be sure and get a cover for the dx.	1
	i got an m-edge leather one that stands upright.	1
	(like a stand) my only beef is i wanted to sell my used (purch oct 08) kindle 2nd gen on amazon.	1
	appears you cannot sell them.	1
	guess they have a monopoly because amazon's still selling them new!	1
	so will have to use craig's list or ebay.	1
	2nd gen like new, with box, and addt'l red leather m-edge cover $225.	1
	(my retail was approx $415 plus shipping)      	1
	kindle dx rocks!.	1
	love my kindle dx.	1
	kindle dx.love my kindle dx, carry it everywhere.	1
	like the size and feel of a hardback book and with the addition of a leather cover it is absolutely perfect!	1
	i like the dictionary application and the easy downloading and that i can make notes of an article or book if i so choose.	1
	highly recommend the kindle dx!      	1
	a real comfort from so far away.the kindle dx is nothing short of a fantastic reading experience for me.	1
	i have been living overseas for the past 35+ years continuous and hauling around books by the ton has gotten expensive.	1
	further, books are like old friends.	1
	i sometimes like to pick up an old and familiar book, just to read it again.	1
	the kindle dx filled a large spot in my life.	1
	it is easy to read, low in energy consumption and totes around more like a notebook planner than an electronic machine.	1
	i can read anytime, anywhere with a flick of a switch.	1
	downloading books from amazon without the 'whispernet' is easy.	1
	i just go to the manage your kindle web page, click on a title i have purchased and tell it to come to my computer.	1
	i get a message on what to do, i tell it to save to drive.	1
	then with the usb cable, i hook up and boot the kindle and drag the titles into the kindle.	1
	one criticism though, amazon needs to get a lot more titles.	1
	300,000+ is never enough for the likes of me.	1
	also, when i call for an author or a title, often i get titles or authors linked up just because one or two words happen to match my request.	1
	i would like authors added like taylor caldwell, james schmitz, clifford d. simak, mary stewart and a host of others who are both living and dead.	1
	it is early days yet, maybe we will see more added soon.	1
	perhaps we could also get the library of congress or the new york library inventory added as well.	1
	i like the capability of displaying pdf format books as well, it opens new horizons.	1
	keep up the good work, amazon.com!      	1
	great device.the kindle dx has certainly lived up to its hype, and is truly easy to use and more importantly, easy to read.	1
	while the interface is not as intuitive as apple's iphone, for example, it is still easy to navigate once you figure out which buttons do what.	1
	the weight is fine, but the configuration is a slight problem: when holding it, the position of the ebook is slightly different from reading a normal book, and can cause arm and wrist fatigue if held for too long.	1
	one suggestion is to use a book stand where available, or a handy pillow or rolled-up jacket or sweater will work just fine.	1
	the lack of color illustrations is not a real hindrance, and i'd be very surprised if kindle did not come out with a color screen version in the near future (with a hefty price tag attached, i'm sure).	1
	the price point for the dx is pretty high, but for someone who does a lot of reading and traveling, whether for business, pleasure, or school, the kindle dx is well worth it.	1
	the biggest downside in our family is that we only have one kindle and several people who are reading books on it at the same time!	1
	call me psychic, but i foresee another kindle or two appearing as birthdays and holidays roll around.      	1
	kindle krazy.	1
	i love my kindle dx!.	1
	great in every way except typing..i had heard about the kindle dx in mid may and decided to give it a try.	1
	i found that it serves its purpose in every way since it is very simple to use and truly gives the experience of reading an actual page minus the bulk or hassle of finding the perfect way to hold it.i prefer to hold it vertically as it is designed, but i have found it just as easy to hold it landscape or upside down if you prefer having the page buttons on the left.additionally, it is unbelievably simple to purchase a book whether it be through my kindle dx, online delivered through whispernet, or by downloading it onto my computer and then syncing it with my kindle dx (this feature was extremely useful when i ran out of books out of the country).the only design feature that bothers me is how difficult it is to type notes or search for books on it.	1
	the device is too wide for the keypad.	1
	i need to put the device down in order to reach the center keys with both hands (instead of holding it and typing with my thumbs).otherwise, i love the kindle in every way, including the experimental features.	1
	the internet works fairly well for being in its early stages and the text-to-speech is far more human-like than other programs.	1
	of course, however, it does not beat an audiobook.overall, it is an incredible product that is somewhat addicting.      	1
	if you like to read....	1
	wow!	1
	love the kindle..i was a bit wary of spending this kind of money on an electronic reading device - but i'm very glad i did!	1
	i love the kindle.	1
	haven't explored all the bells and whistles yet but am very happy with the 2 books that i've read so far (i've only had my kindle for a few weeks).	1
	i'm looking forward to going on vacation - being able to take the books i want to read on the beach and also the cookbooks i'll need while away - all in one small device!	1
	the screen is very easy to see - even in bright daylight and i like having the option to change the size of the font - for those days when my eyes are tired from spending the day in front of a computer screen.	1
	i downloaded a 200 page pdf document and it worked great - no coversions needed.	1
	as for accessories - i ordered a neoprene case to keep it safe and will probably order some type of screen protector when available.	1
	the screen protector that was on the kindle when i received it did not last very long.	1
	i'm not sure if this was ment only as shipping protection or if it was to be left on.	1
	plus it had 'bubbles' under it that drove me nuts.	1
	my recommendation for this item is 'buy it - you'll like it'.      	1
	the best kindle yet!.as an early adoptee of the kindle 1, i have enjoyed my kindle for many books and love the paperless concept.	1
	i was not that impressed with kindle 2, but dx has blown away the others.	1
	i like the 'feel' of the new model.	1
	it is thinner than the kindle 1 but it doesn't feel flimsy, in fact, it feels more natural in my hands.	1
	it is the same size as a magazine.	1
	as someone with eyesight problems.	1
	i appreciate the increasing font size.	1
	i know, that the font sizes are the same as kindle 1, but somehow they seem larger and clearer.	1
	perhaps it is the place between the lines, but it's easier to read!	1
	i don't fully understand some of the complaints about the rotating screen.	1
	you can turn that off!	1
	i just hope that kindle doesn't release another model so soon.	1
	i have to think about selling my other kindle first!        	1
	the greatest!!!!	1
	!.i am becoming concerned that my friends and family will grow tired of my constant ecstatic reviews of my new kindledx!	1
	i'm retired and typically read 2-3 books a week.	1
	the kindle makes that so easy!	1
	if someone were to tell me of a book they recently enjoyed i can have it available on my kindledx in a minute!	1
	the size of the type and the illumination leave nothing to be desired and the built-in dictionary makes the  most obscure word definitions immediately available.	1
	this device is sensational!      	1
	i love it!	1
	went from a sony to a kdx.i upgraded to the kdx from a sony prs-500.	1
	i loved the sony, but i love the kdx more.	1
	pdf functionality has been perfect so far with my image-heavy scientific papers.	1
	i do wish that we could get a firmware update that gives the ability to better organize libraries, by folder or lists.	1
	battery life is excellent, better than my sony, as long as the wireless is turned off.	1
	as far as novels go, i really think that the larger screen helps 'vanish' the device -- fewer page turns allows you to further immerse in the story.	1
	it's expensive, but as a business or educational expense, it is well worth it.	1
	i am hoping my law school texts will be available in ebook or pdf format!      	1
	awesome, love it but.... price and on and off slide not so hot.i cannot compare the dx to the previous versions of kindle, although i wanted to purchase both, i never did.	1
	i was able to purchase this one with the help of my boyfriend because it is simply too expensive.	1
	i wasn't going give up that deal:  splitting the cost.	1
	now, the kindle dx device.	1
	i absolutely love love love my kindle dx!	1
	i look forward to coming home to read every night.	1
	however, i do not enjoy the on, off, sleep button on the top.	1
	in my opinion, the kindle should have an on and off click, where you don't have to slide for 4 seconds to turn off.	1
	i find it extremely annoying.	1
	the sleep feature is cool but, right on the top there could be a simple push down button to put the thing to sleep, right along side the on/off click button.	1
	a couple of times i have tried to turn the kindle dx off and it goes to sleep; then goes back to the book.	1
	not cool.	1
	still and all, i am very very happy with this purchase.	1
	my boyfriend has noticed my complete delight and he is also enjoying my new experience, thus considers it all worth it!	1
	weak on/off/sleep but still awesome awesome awesome!      	1
	not clumsy at all.i too thought it was big and clumsy, at first.	1
	however,after reading with it today for 5 hours.	1
	it was not.	1
	because it is bigger, you can position it in such a way to be comfortable.	1
	much more comfortable than a hard bound book or paperback.	1
	wish list for me: optional backlighting.	1
	when i first started reading ebooks on pda's, that was one of my favorite features along with the quick dictionary lookups and instant book buying abilities.	1
	review of the kindle dx.i have been using my kindle dx for about six months and in general i am well satisfied with it.	1
	but i do have three things that i don't like about it and feel that if kindle would change them, that it would be much more of a benefit to all users.	1
	one, i do not like the use of locations instead of page numbers.	1
	i don't have a feel for locations, for example, if i was on page 900 of a book and wanted to use the  'go to page function' to page 950, it would mean more to me than using the 'go to location' from say 33,000 to say 35,000.  i would rather have page numbers than locations even if the page numbers do not correspond exactly with the actual page numbers in the document.	1
	second, most people don't read a book straight through without wanting to occasionally page backwards or forwards.	1
	having to move one page at a time is frustrating when you want to go say 25 pages.	1
	the kindle user should be able to press say the 'q' button and then the page forward button and move forward 10 pages, pressing 'w' would move forward 20 pages, etc.	1
	the same would be true for going backwards in a document.	1
	third, it is very awkward having both the letters and numbers on the top row of the keyboard and having to use the alt key in order to actually type in numbers.	1
	it is very awkward to hold the dx with one hand and press the alt and number keys at the same time with the other.	1
	it would be much more convenient to have a row of number keys above the letter keys as with a regular keyboard. 	1
	kindle dx - international.	1
	typography, downloads and e-ink.i would think almost everything has been said about the kindle through the reviews that could be but, in addition to what's already listed, i thought it relevant to add a couple of additional points.	1
	1. typography and white space: much is made of the kindle's e-ink.	1
	rightly so, it's great.	1
	but, as a purchaser of an international version of the kindle, my reading experience remains lessened by either the kindle software or the kindle book format.	1
	i have noticed, in a number of instances when reading magazines bought from amazon and for the kindle, that the 'white space' that is often used to separate thoughts, time-frames, perspectives, etc are lost.	1
	and so, when reading through a story, there are moments are sheer double-take when such a shift in the author's intent occurs and you realise that what should have existed was a nice blob of nothingness to create the psychological break.	1
	perhaps a minor issue for some but it really is quite disconcerting when this happens a number of times in a short-story (for reference: alfred hitchcock's mystery magazine was the culprit) and spoils the illusion that what you are reading is a well type-set book.	1
	in other instances, i found that spaces were often missed at ends of sentences with a run between a typographic mark (close quotation) and the capital of the next sentence.	1
	i haven't noticed this in any of the books i've read (a limited count at this point since the kindle is new) and i believe might be due to amazon stripping out pictures/other from the content of the magazine as originally published to save bandwidth when delivered via whispernet.	1
	2. international customers are stiffed in relation to purchases.	1
	the costs are outlined on the amazon site if you dig deep enough but, for those non u.s residents who purchase the device, there is no way to escape the $2 download 'surcharge' that exists in relation to the cost in the u.s. a $9.99 bestseller is that for locals and $11.99 for non-u.s. i accept that as part of the deal.	1
	however, and this is where it galls substantially, a u.s resident can, if they so wish, download a title to their computer when overseas and avoid the $2.00 whispernet non-roaming roaming charge.	1
	non-u.s residents cannot.	1
	i downloaded a title to my computer and amazon charges me $2.00 for that privilege.	1
	sorry, but that is hardly a reasonable position to take in my view and i hope amazon gets a consumer backlash over that one.	1
	it's unfair but does reflect amazon's general habit of charging above and beyond for international customers.	1
	if the above is considered a small issue then this, to me, is more significant.	1
	at the above prices there is a consistent 20% surcharge for every book, a greater percentage for magazines, etc and there is no way to avoid it.	1
	download the book to your computer and amazon banks the greater margin.	1
	very poor customer-centric approach.	1
	3. the device itself has been covered in depth.	1
	reasonable weight, battery life ok and the ergonomics worked for me (i.e., button positions.)	1
	pdf is in-built but limited.	1
	this is something those who believe the kindle will serve their purpose in annotation and highlighting will particularly feel.	1
	i did.	1
	you can't do any of  those things with the pdf files loaded up.	1
	have a notebook handy to jot down references rather than maintain it on the single device.	1
	here is a weakness that many will feel the strongest.	1
	as a general book reader - kindle is great.	1
	as a device to carry work documents it really doesn't work.	1
	you'll need a photographic memory or additional items to capture thoughts, comments or other on anything that's not kindle native.	1
	4. the 'folder' issue.	1
	yeah, well, amazon.	1
	this one's perplexing.	1
	everything just gets banged into the home screen and that's it.	1
	all 3,500 of them.	1
	there are some workarounds but nothing as simple as creating some folders on the device and moving documents around.	1
	again, if you want to load up a couple of books and replace them as you finish then you're in for good times.	1
	if you want to take on amazon's promise that you can load up your multitude of work/research/school files and still find them all ... not so good.	1
	5. legibility.	1
	e-ink.	1
	magic.	1
	if you have reservations about reading on one of these devices 'cause like many of us you read screens (lcd) all day then this is not the same.	1
	a nice experience.	1
	the images work well in the shades of grey offered and the contrast is enough to make reading the experience it can be with a book.	1
	i think the above detracts from the product in meaningful ways.	1
	point 2 is a cost to be carried by those who want global roaming but for those willing to download to a computer?	1
	please pay anyway.	1
	meh.	1
	if you're a magazine reader (lots of small purchases) or getting through lots of books per year this will add up pretty quickly.	1
	it also moves the ebooks back into that very near price parity with the printed book.	1
	and who wants that (other than the publishers)?	1
	ebooks should be cheap and i do applaud amazon's attempt to constrain costs.	1
	but, again for international purchasers, some (potentially a lot!)	1
	of that saving is chewed up in delivery charges.	1
	and then you're left with a book constrained to the device, no second-hand sales to lessen the blow and no sharing with friends to eke out that last bit of residual value.	1
	boo amazon!          	1
	kindle dx.i got the kindle as a christmas present from my husband.	1
	i wasn't sure i would like it because i like the actual turning of pages, but i love it.	1
	it is lightweight and keeps the charge for a really long time.	1
	it is easy to see the text, and it does not strain your eyes like a computer monitor.	1
	there are numerous books for free or a few dollars.	1
	also, the sampling of books creating a wish list of possible picks for the future are nice options.	1
	the drawback of the kindle that frustrates me is the storing ability of the books.	1
	i can't sort them out by author or genre, so i have to keep looking up the book information.	1
	if i am in a limited reception area, the kindle will not bring it up.	1
	i also don't like that books aren't checklisted or some other type of notification that i have purchased the book.	1
	overall, i really love the kindle, and i recommend it to anyone who loves to read.	1
	one recommendation is to get the leather cover.	1
	it keeps the kindle dust free and prevents it from sliding around on inclined surfaces.      	1
	great reading device.	1
	i love my kindle.	1
	kindle dx valuable but limited.	1
	the kindle dx (9.7 ' display) is the answer to travel, and now home.	1
	perfect for a voracious reader with limited shelf space.	1
	big fan of the dx.	1
	a custom library at your fingertips.	1
	power switch.	1
	my second kindle dx.	1
	some room for improvement.	1
	love my kindle.	1
	no love for the visually impaired.first, let me say, if your eyesight is good or only mildly off, the kindle dx is perfect!	1
	however, for those few like myself, with macular degeneration (not correctable with glasses) the kindle comes up short with a max font size of 20pt.	1
	i can read this but i'd prefer a little bigger but when i mentioned this to amazon tech support utter indifference (probably an automated response) was all that was conveyed in response.	1
	i love my kindle dx, i am still going to use it, but when it comes to the visually impaired amazon seems to have 'no love'.        	1
	kindel dx great for books; not for pdf in color!!	1
	!.	1
	an excellent choice, compliments the k2, and well worth the cost.	1
	best in class..i have enjoyed k2 and now the extraordinary kindle dx.	1
	as of 10/09, this is the top-of-the-line kindle product.	1
	i truly love the reading experience, in particular the sunday newspapers!	1
	how nice to have the papers waiting when you wake up!	1
	i like the larger screen on the dx, you turn the page less frequently, and adjusting the font size on the larger screen could not be easier.	1
	though both the k2 and dx are easily portable, this unit is a bit heavier and (of course) larger.	1
	the ability to display pdf files (clearly) makes the the dx a good choice for business types, and students.	1
	there is also a bit of a 'wow' factor with this item - it is the corvette of the current e-readers.	1
	yup, you will get noticed when you use this one.	1
	in using the device, you will probably find that you read more, and perhaps re-discover books you have loved before.	1
	the ability to have newspapers , blog's and magazines at your disposal really will transform the way you process information -everytning is easier!	1
	for those who say you can get material on a cell phone, pda or netbook- well, yes, you could, but do you really ever plan on reading a book or newspaper that way, long term?	1
	the kindle products mimic or enhance an actual traditional print reading experience.	1
	if you have not seen e-ink, you are missing out.	1
	the screen is not like a computer screen and light years away from any cell phone, i promise.	1
	this seems to be the season for e-readers ( as i write this there is an ad for a competing brand on the tv during an nfl pre game show..).	1
	i am aware of another retailer promoting a similar product due to launch in the next 30 days or so.	1
	there is probably room in the marketplace for several brands- but why not go for the best?	1
	( i sort of feel that kindle is a bit like tivo -  you can buy a dvr, or you can get the real deal, the top brand, best-in-class.).	1
	i do hope this helps a bit.	1
	it can be a tough decision to select any electronic device- none of them are inexpensive.	1
	in my opinion, this is not only the first, but the best line of products out there.	1
	i really enjoy the dx and it's screen size.	1
	my whole family (across several states) have enjoyed the kindle products, but none as much as my mom who was an avid reader, until macular degeneration robbed her of a lifelong passion.	1
	the text-to-speech function on kindle 2 and kindle dx  has allowed her to re-connect with ease, and has empowered her.	1
	that alone, is priceless.      	1
	wow.my kindle was the best birthday gift ever !!	1
	i used to enjoy belonging to a book club, but now i don't have to wait for my books to arrive in the mail; now i just select and download and can read right away.	1
	many selections are free or very low cost and others are very reasonably priced.	1
	i have already read 10 books and have 4 ready and waiting to be read.	1
	i am more inclined to try new authors with pricing so reasonable.	1
	keeping the wireless feature turned off until needed saves on battery life, too, so i don't have to charge often.	1
	i used to think kindle would hurt my eyes or give me a headache because of back-lighting, but that is not the case.	1
	it is very easy on the eyes and very similar to reading a printed page.	1
	if you are in doubt, seek out  a friend who has a kindle and ask if you can 'test read' a page.	1
	you will be pleased.	1
	unlike a printed book, no matter if i hold my kindle upside down or sideways, the page adjusts for proper reading.	1
	and the larger size screen is marvelous.	1
	and you can highlight passages and build a clip file to download to your computer and print.	1
	there is a dictionary provided and a search feature .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	can you tell i kinda sorta l-o-v-e my kindle ?	1
	?      	1
	wow, worth every nickel!.i can't believe it does everything it says!	1
	being able to read books, magazines, blogs and news wires while having the functionality of highlighting, bookmarking, annotating, looking up definitions, search the web, buy new books very inexpensively (without having to wait for the paperbacks), listen to my favorite background music while reading and carry everything with me is incredibly great!	1
	oh i didn't forget the best features of being able to carry my work documents in .pdf format, listen to audio books, turn on text-to-speech and the ability to view the screen in portrait and landscape mode!	1
	everyone who sees mine wants one.	1
	don't believe all the people who say you'll never get use to it!	1
	within the first couple of pages you forget you're not reading a book.	1
	the e-ink technology is so much better than looking at a computer screen.	1
	being able to walk out the door without having to decide which book to bring with me is very liberating!	1
	oh and amazon doesn't take books away that you purchase, ever.	1
	if you get a book for free, then you didn't purchase it did you?	1
	(yeah the free books are great too!)	1
	i can't wait for a color version so i bought this one and will buy the color version as soon as it becomes available!       	1
	dad's gift.i recently purchased the kindle dx for my dad for father's day.	1
	i was a little concerned beacuse he is 78 and it is a big change from his usual form of reading.	1
	he immediately started using it and has had nothing but positive things to say about it.	1
	his remarks caused me to purchase one for myself.	1
	i have not received it yet but i hope the font adjustment will make for a more consistent reading experience.	1
	some paperbacks just have too small a print.      	1
	best new ebook reader on the market.because i have problems reading because of failing eyssight i thought i would give the kindle dx a shot.	1
	it is like night and day.	1
	i can read again.	1
	with the large type i have again discovered the joys of reading.	1
	i have not put it down since i have gotten it.	1
	a great product for those who have eyesight problems.	1
	i will never read a regular book again!!	1
	!.i've had my kindle dx since august and i absolutely love it!	1
	i read almost constantly.	1
	i originally bought my kindle because i was having major surgery and would not be able to leave the house for at least 3 months.	1
	i would not be able to buy more books and i was tired of paying shipping charges on online orders.	1
	i love the instant wireless transfer and the ability to shop for books on the kindle itself, rather than having to log in online.	1
	at first i wasn't sure i liked reading on the kindle because i was aware that it was an electronic device the whole time.	1
	however, after three days, i adjusted and forgot i was reading on a device instead of an actual book.	1
	one thing i was worried about before receiving my kindle was whether my eyes would tire from reading.	1
	but the kindle reads better than a book!	1
	my eyes never get tired and i'm actually able to read for longer periods of time on the kindle compared to a book.	1
	i have a focusing problem with my eyes and i have to wear reading glasses.	1
	however, i don't have to wear them when i read on my kindle.	1
	based on this alone, i would never go back to reading a regular book, but there are so many more reasons why the kindle is better!	1
	i could sit here and write a huge list of everything i love, but it would be several pages long.	1
	i love my kindle!!!	1
	my friends have bought them after seeing mine and each of them has fallen in love with it too!	1
	i only wish that textbooks were available.	1
	i'm a senior in college (on break for surgery) but i plan to go to grad school in 2011.  it would be amazing to have all my textbooks on a single kindle.	1
	for students, it would cut down on the amount of books to carry around campus, sometimes as many as 6 at a time, and would reduce the cost of college by saving thousands on books.	1
	amazon would benefit from sales as well.	1
	i think this is a logical next step for the kindle and i hope the amazon team is working on it now!      	1
	kindle's voice mode.	1
	retired.the product is very nice but... it would be much improved with backlighting, allowing for reading in bed while a spouse sleeps.	1
	i was very disappointed to realize, after purchasing, that magazines and newspapers are very limited.	1
	perhaps in the future, this will improve.      	1
	excellent readability.i'm moving out of the country soon and can't take a couple hundred of my favorite books with me, so the kindle dx was my birthday present to help me cope with that.	1
	i chose the dx over the kindle 2 because it's supposed to do a lot better with pdf files, and i want all the formats i can get since the kindle will be my main source of reading, instead of just a supplement to normal books.	1
	my mother has the kindle 2, and as a fast reader i strongly prefer the bigger screen, as i don't have to turn the page as often as i would with a smaller screen.	1
	the height and length of the surface of the kindle is about the same as a hardback book, but it is much slimmer and lighter weight.	1
	holding it in both hands, with or without a protective cover/case is very comfortable, but it's too big to easily hold with one hand unless it's balanced on my leg or a table as well.	1
	the frame of the dx feels pretty sturdy, though i did get a sturdy leather cover to protect the screen.	1
	it's just as easy to read with the cover on it, and i can hold it the same way i would hold a hardback book if i want to, or fold the cover back around so it's not much wider that the dx.	1
	prior to seeing a kindle in person, i was pretty skeptical about readability of the screen.	1
	but the screen is nothing like a typical lcd or other screen i've ever seen on an electronic device.	1
	instead of lighting up pixels, the kindle screen electronically manipulates ink to form the text or pictures.	1
	so it's no harder on the eyes than reading a normal book, with the advantage that i can adjust text size by hitting a couple buttons.	1
	awesome!	1
	the text is somewhat pixelated, but i only notice it if i look really close for it.	1
	the text is crisp and nicely formed, and looks more natural than what i would expect from a normal screen.	1
	pictures, graphs, tables, etc, tend to look slightly blurred, but are still easily legible.	1
	increasing the font might make them crisper.	1
	the most awesome thing about the ink screen technology is that it isn't using any power to keep a page displayed.	1
	some power is used to change the page, but one a page is up, it's basically a real, solid, permanent thing until it gets changed.	1
	this means you can leave it on forever and not use up the battery any faster than you would if it were turned off.	1
	if i don't hit any buttons for a while it automatically goes to one of many stored literary sketches.	1
	it can be turned off completely by holding the power button to the right for a few seconds until the screen completely clears, but there's really no need.	1
	the menus and settings are simple and easy to navigate, but i'll probably regret the lack of subfolders for sorting books when i've built up more of a library.	1
	but for now, the ability to  sort by author or title is quite sufficient for me.	1
	downloading books is fast and easy, and the dx was able to use my amazon.com account data to steamline the process.	1
	searching for books is also fairly easy, but it would be nice to be able to search the same way we can on the website, such as by price.	1
	i love free books!	1
	the selection of books is pretty extensive, and i found about a dozen free ones that sounded well worth reading, and a dozen or so more at more typical prices that are an integral part of my hardcopy (and doomed) library.	1
	oh, as a dvorak keyboard geek, i'd prefer a dvorak option for the keyboard.	1
	but it's not a huge issue because the keyboard is too small to type with anyhow, so it would just be a matter of speeding up the 2-finger typing process on the rare occasion that i shop for books.      	1
	change of heart - my kindle dx is on its way back!.	1
	the one thing i need from my kindle.there's not much to say other than i love my kindle dx.	1
	normally i read about a book a week and find i read a little faster on my kindle.	1
	probably because i cary it everywhere and take that normally wasted time waiting for elevators and so on to read either a novel or the newspaper i subscribe to, the international harold tribune.	1
	however, i will say that if i could choose just one additional feature to the kindle it would be a single file for books read.	1
	if that is not possible then possibly a way to denote one novel or newspaper has been read - say ... the ability to change the title to italics or something along those lines.	1
	come on, richard branson is selling tickets for space tourism, i'm certain we can do this one simple kindle addition.	1
	can't we?	1
	thank you,david byck      	1
	my first e-reader.this review won't be long.	1
	this is my first e-reader.	1
	i honestly have to say that i love my kindle dx.	1
	there are some text that is too small to read but i just don't think i have figured out how to make it bigger.	1
	my only other complaint was the price.	1
	it was a lot of money to spend...but it was my birthday and i splurged.	1
	at any rate, the pictures are crisp, the words are crisp, i am comfortable with the weight and yes it is much bigger than the kindle 2 but i'm ok with it too. 	1
	i love it!.i am very pleased with my kindle dx !	1
	it is easy to learn and operate and travels well.	1
	all in all - i am thrilled with my purchase!      	1
	best gift ever!.my husband is delighted with his new kindle.	1
	it would be beneficial to have a second battery -- nothing worse than having the battery run out right in the middle of 'the good part'.	1
	otherwise, works well anywhere, anytime.	1
	thanks!      	1
	i waited for the dx.	1
	i waited for the amazon kindle dx because i like reading full size books.	1
	this is a delightful way to read while traveling, in the air, on the beach, or just enjoying a good book.	1
	the audio reading could be a little more coordinated, but it is a minor item.      	1
	unbelievable.i bought this for my wife as she is in a book club.	1
	i was worried as it's a first gen.  but hey...it has it's own unique setup...and you just plug it in and turn it on.	1
	wow it's that easy.	1
	read the easy steps and your downloading books and your on your way...and it's completely wireless too and you have your own mobile book.	1
	it's thinner than we thought, smarter too, with automatic shut off and wake up.	1
	now, if it could only cook!      	1
	nix on periodicals.the kindle dx is an amazing device for reading books.	1
	i am very disappointed with respect to magazines and newspapers.	1
	the navigation is difficult,and all the content is not there.	1
	i thought that i would see the actual layout of the pages and would see the graphics (particularly important in situations like 'the world' in time.	1
	not there.	1
	the new york times times reader 2.0 is a far superior reading experience; although that requires a pc connection.      	1
	great upgrade with one quirk.i use my kindle for magazines and newspapers almost exclusively.	1
	thus, the dx was a no brainer.	1
	i love the larger real estate.	1
	i can immediately see the benefit every morning when reading the new york times or the wall street journal.	1
	however, so far, the newspapers do not seem to be taking advantage of the larger screen.	1
	so far, its just more text on the screen.	1
	i am hoping that we will see more integrated screen pages in the future - those with text and pictures, or text and charts on the same screen.	1
	this is why i was so excited about the dx and this is what i am hoping willhappen.	1
	the one quirk?	1
	the keyboard buttons have been greatly downsized.	1
	barely readable.	1
	if you use your dx for other than reading, and write lots of notes or type in lots of web sites in the experimental section, you will be disappointed.	1
	not only are the buttons too small, they are impossible to read.	1
	this is, in reality more than just a quirk i guess.	1
	its a design flaw.	1
	if you have an eyesight problem or need heavy duty glasses to type on a computer keyboard, this will not work.	1
	but with amazon's return policies so good, it is worth a shot to try it out.       	1
	excellent for screen size, however, pdf support is in infancy.....i love my kindle 2 that i bought two months ago when it first came out - and i love the new screen size of the kindle dx that i bought the day it was announced...  apart from it being almost awkwardly bulky, i love the screen size...  it really does make reading so much easier!	1
	however, if your primary reason for buying the kindle dx is the native pdf support, be aware that most of the document support functions that you may have grown to appreciate on the kindle, does not currently work for pdf.	1
	while the pdf's do look exactly like the computer version there are a few disappointments in this feature: - the table of contents in pdf documents are not clickable in the kindle rendering, thus you still have to wade through each page by hand.	1
	a plus side is that the pdf pages are exactly the same as the original document - so you can use the go to page function - but you still have to do a lot of clicking.	1
	- the highlighting and text annotation does not work with pdf documents - the read-to-me function does not work with pdf documents.	1
	i'm hoping that amazon is going to remedy this without making me buy yet a new version of the kindle.however, being that one of the main selling points was native pdf support (something i think they should have included for free in upgrades to the kindle 2 that i bought three months ago when it first came out), and the native pdf support is very much in infancy - i would advise buyers to hold off in buying the kindle dx to see what model they come out with next (unless you have 500$ to spare).	1
	one other side note:  i sure hope that amazon is not setting up precedence for future upgrades with the 'every time we provide a functional software upgrade, you need to buy a new kindle to take advantage of it' posture, granted, this is a software and hardware upgrade, but why not upgrade the 4 month old kindle 2 to support pdf too?	1
	if amazon is in the process of updating the functionality of the pdf support (and not requiring me to buy yet another kindle to get it); i'd gladly change this to a 6 out of 5 star review.	1
	disappointed in contrast.i purchased this item because my husband is vision impaired.	1
	although the print can be enlarged the contrast is very low, the background is gray (not white) and the letters are not a sharp dark color.	1
	we do love the download feature, the dictionary and all the other features (including the sound) but wished the contrast was a little better.      	1
	kindle dx $[...] mistake.my husband ordered the kindle dx for me for our anniversary on june 30. luckily for me it has been on back order since allowing me time to research and look for books that i would add to my kindle list.	1
	unfortunately, the reviews for this product have made me feel that money would be thrown out the window.	1
	not being able to own your books or share your books is a bit scary to me.	1
	after paying hard-earned money and purchasing books, then waking up to find that they have been removed is a bit scary to me.	1
	along with the fact that there is no organization to this is unacceptable.	1
	too much buzz, nothing much backing it up.	1
	please read customer reviews before purchasing.	1
	i feel good that after a month of waiting has prevented me from making a $[...]+ mistake.[...]	1
	it doesn't work.	1
	two strikes against dx.i couldn't wait to get my kindle dx.	1
	when it finally got here, the screen was defective, having a dead line going the whole length of the screen.	1
	then, after multiple attempts over several days, i could not access the net even though amazon said i should have topnotch accessibility.	1
	for the price, this unit should dazzle and at a minimum work as advertised.	1
	i returned it and asked for a refund rather than a replacement.	1
	other gripes--in the non-kindle world, when a book is released in paperback, the price drops significantly.	1
	not true in kindle-land.	1
	it's actually much cheaper to buy a paperback version of a book at costco than it is to buy it via kindle.	1
	i was also amazed at how many books are priced over the $9.99 price so touted by amazon in the sales promos of kindle.	1
	overall, i still have hope that the embryonic e-book world will some day catch fire and replace paper books in a way similar to how the pocket calculator replaced the slide rule, but for now, we aren't there yet.	1
	maybe when apple weighs in with an i-ebook, then we will see magic happen.       	1
	worth the money but....i went from an original kindle to the dx, primarily for it's pdf functionality and some extra space.	1
	extra space it has, in loads... but if you are coming straight from a smaller e-book reader, it will seem cumbersome at first.	1
	those extra 2' in each direction offer a good amount of reading space, but also add to the weight and size substantially... my dx does not feel invisible, as my kindle1 did.	1
	maybe it will just take time to adjust, but so far i am very pleased and will just have to acclimate to its weighty nature...      	1
	nothing but problems so far....	1
	having serious doubts - but not quite stable.i have loved the how easy the experience was to install.. very comfortable to handle despite bigger size.. however i have had some issues that worry me.. the machine has hanged more than once.. then it rebooted on it own at least once.. then i did not get 3g to work for a while.. i needed to force a reboot to get it back to work.. i did call support.. then it was off hours.. i logged na email 3 days ago, nobody has returned a call or email to me.. i hope in am not forced to return the unit in the next week if i get no answers      	1
	kindle dx needs document organization features for pdfs.we got a kindle dx at work a few weeks ago.	1
	while it works quite well in general, my main remaining impression is that it desperately needs to take advantage of hierarchical filesystem organization or to add some additional document organization capability in order to realize its full potential.	1
	i work in a research laboratory where my colleagues and i typically have piles of printed research papers in file drawers, piled on desks, and carried around in briefcases.	1
	we bought a kindle dx to explore its potential to eliminate the need to keep printed copies of these papers, and although it appears to measure up in all other respects, the lack of ability to organize documents negates the benefit of the large internal storage capacity.	1
	in just 5 minutes of downloading papers, it became clear that the 'single level document list' user interface implemented on the kindle dx would be completely unusable for people like myself that would like to keep hundreds of documents loaded onto the device at a time, or in cases where a single kindle dx is shared by more than one person.	1
	the remaining issues i'd like to see addressed in the future are more minor and concern convenience of reading pdf files containing detailed tables, 3-d plots, charts, and other graphics, where the current inability to 'zoom' the display hampers readability in some cases.	1
	if these two drawbacks are addressed in future firmware updates, i and many of my colleagues would buy a kindle dx for personal use in a mere heartbeat.      	1
	fantastic device, but content too expensive..i recently won a kindle dx in a scavenger hunt competition.	1
	i purchased, downloaded and read one novel (lost secret by dan brown).	1
	i enjoyed the kindle dx, but ultimately decided to sell it.	1
	i've given my reasons below: what i liked:   1. beautiful and sleek design.	1
	2. very light and easy to hold.	1
	3. easy to read, even in the direct sunlight.	1
	4. read like real printed material.	1
	it was easy on the eyes, not anything like reading a computer screen.	1
	5. the ability to very easily look up definitions of words.	1
	6. the ability to highlight and take notes.	1
	7. the iphone kindle app.	1
	i could keep my kindle at home and easily pick up my book exactly where i left off.	1
	it was great when i was waiting in line, having lunch at work, etc.	1
	what i disliked:   1. content: the primary reason i decided to sell my kindle was the cost of content.	1
	$10 for a digital copy of a book is expensive, considering the hardcover is only $15.	1
	i would definitely consider paying a few more dollars for the hardcover edition if it included the digital copy.	1
	the same way dvd and blu-ray movies sometimes include a digital copy of the movie.	1
	i would also consider purchasing a subscription that gave me access to a large variety of content.	1
	maybe something that gave me access to several pieces of content per month.	1
	like the old netflix model.	1
	2. design:         -it would be nice to have the option to adjust the contrast of the screen.	1
	-it was annoying having the numerical keys integrated with the alphabet keys.	1
	-the text search feature didn't always work right.	1
	there were words and/or phrases that i knew where in the document i was reading, but i could not find them with the search function.	1
	-the page numbering system makes it difficult to reference what you've read or compare where you are at to where someone else is.	1
	it does tell your percent completion, but that is not very detailed.	1
	for instance, you may have to read 50 pages before you've increased your percentage completion by 1%.	1
	what i'd like to see in future kindle editions (ranked in order starting with most desired):   1. increase in speed.	1
	2. better way to organize and search for content on the kindle.	1
	3. the ability to lend out books to friends and family.	1
	i    4. ability to read a wider variety of formats.	1
	i had problems reading certain pdfs.	1
	5. color.	1
	not necessary, but would be nice to have.	1
	6. touch screen.	1
	again, not necessary, but would be nice to have.	1
	7. i know this will never happen, but it would be nice to have the ability to sell used digital content.	1
	just like i can sell a physical copy of a book, i'd like to be able to sell an old digital copy.  	1
	great in theory but disappointing.i am returning the kindle, so i wanted to provide feedback.	1
	1 -i purchased this kindle for my father who has macular degeneration in the hopes he would be able to do some large print reading.	1
	2- even held in a landscape position there is not enough screen/reading space for the visually impaired to use the tool well.	1
	a better size would have been a screen 8x16-18 inches, easier to read and more comfortable to hold, more like a book.	1
	it is kind of hard to hold for any length of time, and harder still in the landscape position.	1
	3- all of the buttons are too small to be clearly seen or easily used by a 50 year old let alone an 80 year old.	1
	and, when reading in the landscape position the buttons are poorly placed.	1
	i can't emphasize this enough.	1
	4- you expect users to go online and print a 128 page instructions document.	1
	not sending the instructions out with it is ridiculous.	1
	5- it is so disfuntional, i don't even want it.	1
	disappointed, p curran      	1
	amazing device!.	1
	bigger really is better.	1
	best investment i have made.	1
	good but needs a few more features.a good product.	1
	the e-ink screen is easy on the eyes.	1
	the screen size is just big enough for reviewing pdf's for school.	1
	the rotate option is good for when you want to see a page in more detail.	1
	needs:it needs folders so you can organise your pdf's.it needs a zoom option.it needs more options so you can change things like the length of time before it goes into sleep mode (really annoying when you're trying to read dense medical literature).it would be nice if i could get free kindle copies of books i've purchased already through amazon.every textbook i use for school is not available on kindle.	1
	the kindle dx is obviously aimed more at academia, so they really need to work on the above options.	1
	cheers.      	1
	possibly a statistical freak?.let me say at once that, in spite of the ** review i love my kindle dx--when it works.	1
	since i have not seen the issue of reliability or defects brought up in other reviews,  it is possible that my experience is extremely rare.	1
	i have sent back two dxs in a month and am now on my third.	1
	the defect was the same in both cases, complete and instant and incurable lapse into chaos of the display.	1
	in the first instance i found myself looking at virginia wolf's hair, forehead, and nose, while, a fin, apparently jaws', approached from the left.	1
	fuzzy lines of print remained below.	1
	the second instance was very similar.	1
	amazon was in both cases totally honorable and efficient about replacing the units--by overnight delivery with pre-paid return.	1
	but this was in the united states.	1
	i bought my kindle because i take long trips abroad, and run up horrid charges in overweight luggage, quite largely because of books.	1
	if these lapses had happened in italy, say, with foreign customs between amazon and me, it would have been much more frustrating.	1
	so, buyer to this extent, beware.	1
	otherwise i love it.	1
	i could ask for more foreign titles (french and italian for me).	1
	i don't care about pdf files, tagging, folders, etc.	1
	in fact i am highly technophobe, and it is surprising i like the kindle at all.	1
	but i do.      	1
	good thing i waited.got my kindle dx last week, and so far i have no regrets buying this device.	1
	considering that this is more expensive than kindle 2, the screen is larger, it reads pdf files and screen rotates with ease.	1
	i think this is a good investment for those who want to save on buying books and wants to keep them for a longer period of time.	1
	i would suggest buying a case from wireless central (not that expensive compared to that of amazon's) to protect your kindle on the go.	1
	overall, i highly recommend this device.      	1
	the dx is a hit with me!.	1
	i {heart} my kindle dx.i knew i would pre-order the kindle dx long before the rumors of its summer 2009 arrival.	1
	i fell in love with the kindle and kindle 2, purchased both, and re-gifted them to highly appreciative family members.	1
	my love affair with everything kindle is because i'm an avid reader that cannot be without something new to read.	1
	i spend a small fortune on books.	1
	if i'm interested in an author i don't have the patience to wait until the paperback comes out.	1
	i would pre-order books from my local bookstore and if they were out of copies i'd back order it and have it delivered to my home or the store, whichever was quickest.	1
	in the meantime, i'd be chomping at the bit waiting for its arrival.	1
	the kindle solves all those problems.	1
	i can order books at a discounted price, i don't have to wait for the ups guy to deliver it and i don't have to camp outside the bookstore on the release date of the latest book from my favorite author.	1
	another perk is that i'm saving the environment.	1
	no more dead trees!!!	1
	not to mention that my bedroom is no longer cluttered with books.	1
	i plan to sell or give them to the local library.	1
	when people become aware that i own a kindle, the cost for the device is always mentioned; that, and their envy that i have one and they don't.	1
	when i tell them how much money i save in book costs and the convenience of downloading a new book within minutes, they soon understand why i was willing to spend so much.	1
	having owned all 3 models of the kindle, i can say that they all have become progressively better.	1
	all the things that were issues, such as, key location, font sizes, print clarity, etc, all were improved.	1
	the native pdf is a nice plus but has room for improvement.	1
	it loses its hypertext links so you can't navigate to sections as you'd expect.	1
	that would be my only criticism of the device.	1
	the biggest improvement by far is the bigger display and improved print quality.	1
	it's should be obvious that i'm truly attached to my kindle.	1
	i haven't named it but i have been known to hug it while espousing to all that will listen its many virtues.	1
	thanks amazon.	1
	you've made this bookworm ecstatically happy.       	1
	kindle dx.this kindle dx is the best thing for readers.	1
	it is easy an convinent for on the go people.	1
	when i would go on vacation i would have to take a couple books with me.	1
	now i can just download my books and do not have to worry about the books.	1
	my daughter-in-law has the first kindle.	1
	i am so glad that i waited for this version.	1
	i would recommend this to anyone....do your self a favor you deserve it.	1
	i bought this one for my birthday.      	1
	source of knowledge.i love the new kindle dx.	1
	i love it love it love it love it!	1
	i am a student and it is perfect for all of the studying i have to do.	1
	i love that i can highlight text and take notes.	1
	it has been amazing.	1
	having the dictionary on there is also freaking amazing.	1
	i can know any definition to any word on the page in under 5 seconds.	1
	it is really great!      	1
	what a great way to read all my books.	1
	i would give the dx 10 stars if i could =).my 1st kindle was a kindle 2.i loved it!	1
	!then went on to buy a kindle 1 as travel kindle,so that i would have 1 at home and one always with me.i decided to order the kindle dx the day after jeff bezos announced it.i received it june 12th,and immediately i knew it was something spectacular.things i truly enjoy about my kdx:the larger screen.this equals less page turns,and more words per page.i also like being able to tell the kindle if i want less or more words per page displayed.i enjoy being able to turn it on it's side to read recipes while cooking,and to view illustrations.the text is incredibly crisp,and is definitely better than it was on my kindle 2,and i thought my kindle 2's text was great.the kdx is not overly heavy at all,and is still very portable.i am so impressed with my kindle dx,and it's larger size that i sold my kindle 2 and have ordered a 2nd kdx.the kindle dx is just more fun to read on,and i found myself reaching for my kdx more than the other 2 kindles i own.for anyone thinking about a kindle dx,give it a try..it is absolutely a wonderful e-reader =)      	1
	2 fixes needed.i own k2 and have had dx for 8 days of heavy use.	1
	i believe a lot of the pdf complaints are overstated.	1
	with regard to print size, if you control the document fix (crop etc.	1
	)it in acrobat and re-load.	1
	i have done this with several pdfs and been very pleased with the results.	1
	two important fixes - the easy one first.	1
	1) an organizational tool is mandatory.	1
	i'm up to 71 documents in just 8 days.	1
	this will never be a 'highly efficent' research/educational solution without it.	1
	2) pdf highlighting/note-taking.	1
	this may be harder to accomplish and i only want it because i'm so hooked on the highlighting/note-taking capability i've experienced with kindle books.  	1
	the big problem is the screen contrast.i wanted to love the kindle dx.	1
	my college age daughter (with younger eyes) adores her kindle 2i.	1
	with the larger screen of the dx and the ability to change font sizes, i had really hoped that i'd go back to being the avid reader i once was.	1
	being sort of a gadget nut, (laptop & iphone owner) i do feel that the dx is somewhat archaic and overpriced, however, i was willing to foot the bill if it meant reading comfortably once again.	1
	my biggest criticism is the low contrast of the screen.	1
	for me, it was not like reading a book or magazine.	1
	even though the text size is adjustable, the darker grey of the text against the grey of the background does not provide enough contrast for me, and my eyes became strained & fatigued quickly.	1
	the problem is that the text is not dark or crisp enough to stand out from the grey background.	1
	you are not able to adjust these contrast settings which, in my case, was a deal breaker.	1
	i hated that i had to send the dx back.	1
	but last night i read a regular hardback book in bed and it was much easier on my eyes.	1
	if amazon comes up with a better contrast ratio for the dx, or at least adjustable, i would be happy to give it another try. 	1
	short, but to the point.....	1
	kindle dx for visually handicapped individuals.	1
	lots of pluses, virtually no negatives.	1
	much-loved & well-designed e-reader.i didn't buy the k1 or k2.	1
	i found their small screens off-putting.	1
	as an avid reader of newspapers, other nonfiction, and blogs with graphs & tables (e.g.	1
	cognitive daily), the dx was the obvious first e-reader for me.	1
	it's a joy to own.	1
	sitting on the metro, i can read the my post or nyt without folding in thirds, hitting my neighbor, or finding that the article jumps to a section i didn't throw in my purse.	1
	if you, like me, enjoy exploring all kinds of ideas as you come across them and want a nearly frictionless way to read peripatetically, a kindle's for you.	1
	if you have the space, cash, and visual preferences for a dx, *that's* the kindle for you.       	1
	an awesome ebook reader.the kindle dx is my second ebook reader.	1
	the first one was foxit eslick.	1
	i ordered the eslick because it supported pdf.	1
	i was disappointed by it's size(as big as kindle 2) but i decided to keep it... till kindle dx showed up.	1
	the pdf support is great.	1
	i can finally read my safari bookshelf collection on an ebook reader.	1
	the landscape mode is great in that it increases the text size but i think it's prone to miss a line on some pages.	1
	a separate zoom feature is needed and i will expect amazon to build on the pdf features.	1
	the keyboard is ok, i am not too excited about using the alt key for numbers all the time but i can live with it.	1
	the screen is superb.	1
	i like the kindle store very much.	1
	everything is nice.	1
	i am very excited and happy to have this device.      	1
	kindle and me.	1
	love my kindle dx 9.7.i have recently bought the kindle dx 9.7 and couldn't be happier with my purchase!	1
	and i found out that amazon has loads of books for the kindle that are all free!	1
	i have already downloaded about 20 free books to my kindle.	1
	and the prices of the other books for it are great too!	1
	i believe it downloads up to 35,000 books?	1
	and with a new house that no longer has a special library for books - this is the best way to buy, read, and save as many books as my heart desires and doesn't take any room to store them in!	1
	sure, everyone is going to start making their version of e-books, but for now - this is the best thing i have bought in ages.	1
	i love all the extra features this kindle has too!	1
	i only buy books for it - so i have no need for a color display.	1
	you can do so much more than i have even learned so far.	1
	i can't wait to learn some of the 'special features' it has...so they have e-books on how to find all the special things it can do, for only 25 cents!	1
	please amazon, don't raise your prices on the books!!!!!	1
	!       	1
	pleasant reading, pdf support could be better.	1
	kindle review.	1
	new kindle - love it!.	1
	kindle book.	1
	astounding.	1
	love my new kindle dx.	1
	love my kindle.i absolutely love my kindle.	1
	i love to read and i can take this anywhere and read my books and other media.	1
	it is just fantastic.      	1
	don't leave home without it!.	1
	nearly perfect.	1
	great gift!!	1
	!.	1
	i am so glad i got the kindle dx.	1
	kindle dx ok but not up to the hype.	1
	what an awesome reader!.	1
	great product.	1
	the dx is everything that's advertised..	1
	shock 'n awe!.	1
	great convenience.	1
	new user.	1
	reading on the go.	1
	kindle dx e-reader review.	1
	kindle dx is amazing!.	1
	kindle- the good, the bad and the ugly!.	1
	faster and more comfortable than reading than from a book!.	1
	kindle a work in progress.	1
	the ultimate reading device for the avid reader.the kindle dx is perfect if you're trying to read something.	1
	whether its a pdf or a book you downloaded from amazon, the large e-ink screen looks great and has minimal eye strain.	1
	the reading experience has plenty of perks.	1
	the in-line dictionary, text to speech, landscape reading, dynamic font sizes, and fast page turn are wonderful.	1
	then there is the internet access.	1
	3g really sets this device apart from any other e-readers on the market today.	1
	the experimental web browser easily handles mobile web content, so getting onto nytimes, cnn, wikipedia, google news (and gmail and reader for that matter), and more is easier than ever.	1
	it's like having your own hitch hikers guide to the galaxy.	1
	and its a lot better than reading those sites on your phone.	1
	some sites cause the kindle to crash though, and that can be frustrating.	1
	textbooks and newspapers look pretty good on this device.	1
	i loaded five 300+ page science textbooks i had in pdf and read them all.	1
	in landscape mode the text is as large as it would be in the paper version, and having it as a pdf on my kindle saved me from having to carry 20 lbs of books.	1
	note taking is not easy with pdf, but i take notes on paper anyways so propping the kindle up on a desk and writing with ink and paper was no different from having the paper textbook with me.	1
	newspapers are great because i don't get ink all over my hand and they arrive before the paper copy does, all with zero environmental impact.	1
	the device itself feels great in your hands.	1
	it's thin and sleek, and all the surfaces feel smooth and well constructed.	1
	the keyboard is a little odd, too wide to type like to do on the blackberry, and a bit gummy to type on.	1
	the dx is a bit heavy, especially with the case--but if i'm sitting in my chair at home i'll take it out of the case and have no problem propping it up with one hand.	1
	the battery life is phenomenal, i went on a week long trip and read late into the night each day and it didn't need a single charge.	1
	they say about 4 days with the wireless on and 2 weeks with it off.	1
	the mp3 player is a bit lacking with limited controls, but between project gutenberg and librivox i'm never without something to read or someone to read it to me when i'm tired of the text to speech voice.	1
	the kindle store has best in class book acquisition.	1
	it is dead simple to download your favorite newspapers, magazines or books.	1
	the pdf support lacks zoom, but using a program like stanza, it is easy to get any book into kindle format.	1
	additionally, sites like kindle feeder deliver all your favorite blogs to your email or to the kindle over wireless for next to nothing (free if you load it using usb).	1
	if the 10+ cent cost of file conversion is putting you off, remember that you can always email you files to [...] and they'll email the converted file back for free.	1
	then just load it up via usb.	1
	you don't have to transfer everything via whispernet.	1
	between the kindle store,  stanza, public domain books, google books, kindle reader, the 4 gb of memory on this device, and the web browser, i'll never run out of things to read or be without an enjoyable way to read them.	1
	another design plus: the powerchord and the usb dongle have a very small footprint.	1
	most people don't mention this but the power cable is a tiny add-on to the usb chord instead of the typical power brick you find on other chargers.	1
	an awesome feat of engineering.	1
	that said the device is only for people who read a lot.	1
	$489 is a lot to spend if you read very little, or are looking for a powerful web browser.	1
	at about $30 a month you can get 3g access for a netbook or smartphone, which adds up to $360 a year.	1
	that cost is covered with the kindle, but it won't fit in your pocket and you won't be watching any youtube videos.	1
	also the joystick isn't the best navigation device.	1
	amazon is in the right here, because a touch screen would lower the contrast and clarity of the e-ink.	1
	with the joystick, it takes a second to get to the word you want to highlight or define, and sometimes the cursor flies past that word and you have to push up to get it back to the right spot.	1
	with dynamic things like cursors, you're limited by the e-ink.	1
	but like i said, if you read a lot, this is one of the best purchases you'll ever make.	1
	pros amazing e-ink tech looks fantastic, carry your entire library with you, free internet, highlight and take notes, usb connectivity, mp3 support, native pdf (essential if you have a lot of business or school docs), fast page turns, sleek device, great power chord design, easier to get content than you would ever imagine.	1
	cons a bit heavy, limited web browser (sometimes causes the device to restart), gummy keyboard, no video support, limited mp3 controls, monochrome (although it will be years and $1000s of dollars before we have affordable color e-ink screens), no expandable memory, joystick is less awesome than a touch screen or typical mouse.	1
	bottom line the e-ink screen, free internet, and vast internal memory make this the ultimate, ultra-protable reading device.	1
	this gets four stars because it isn't for everyone, and isn't perfect yet.	1
	but if you're an avid reader and don't want to wait a whole year for the next version, get the kindle dx today.      	1
	wanted to love, but....i was very excited when the kindle finally showed up.	1
	it's graceful, thin and light.	1
	not too mention the larger size was perfect.	1
	now here's the 'but.'	1
	it can only read certain formats.	1
	and while pdf will for the most part work for me, the absolute must have is the ability to make notes/comments to sections of the pdf docs i'm reading.	1
	the kindle does not allow you to do this.	1
	i was heartbroken and literally returned it the very next day (no sense falling in love if i already knew it couldn't do all that i needed it to)      	1
	kindle dx.this item was a gift.	1
	the ease of using this product is great.	1
	it is very compact and light, also its portability does away with carrying a bulky book or two to places.	1
	no more blurred pages from the printer and the font is great.	1
	all of perks with the dx are great (ie dictionary etc).	1
	downloading of books is very simple and quite affordable.	1
	if you are a reading enthusiast i highly recommend this product.      	1
	kindle dx.	1
	lovvvvvvve itttt.looove it.	1
	i'm a book and mag whore.	1
	i  thougt i would hate this thing.	1
	my boyfriend on the other hand loves it.	1
	no more piles of books.	1
	cant wait until theres a color version.	1
	then i can get my mag.	1
	the only problem i have is getting used to the profile of the kindle.	1
	im used reading w/ two hands.	1
	thats it i've been reading the reviews for the kindle for a while.	1
	i thougt i would never give up my books.	1
	thanks love itdqs      	1
	just about perfect!.love the kindle dx!	1
	this device does exactly what it claims to do, and does so very well!	1
	there's definitely room for improvement, but amazing nonetheless.	1
	for those requesting a touch-screen, better internet capability, color images, faster page turning, etc., just keep in mind that this is a book reader, not a computer or pda.	1
	and therefore, in my opinion, less is more.	1
	the size is right, the screen quality is outstanding, and things like the free wireless downloading of books are all strong selling points.	1
	if i want to connect to the internet or snap photos, i'll use another device to do so.	1
	that said, here's a list of pros, cons, and suggested do's & don'ts.	1
	pros:> extensive collection of books and content, with more lower priced titles than others> sleek, solid, well-designed device> larger screen size, perfect for reading, excellent viewing quality> landscape view> pdf support> free wireless downloads, w/o the need for contracts or computer!!	1
	!> mac compatible (iphone/ipod touch app also available); unlike sony, this proves that amazon is in touch with what people are using these days> ability to shop the kindle store from your backyard or a hotel room> overnight wireless delivery of popular newspapers> cool layout, design, and packaging (once upon a time...) cons:> expensive (i think $399 would be a more realistic selling price for the dx)> poorly-designed leather case (i chose not to purchase this accessory in fear of it damaging the screen as reported by several others)> amazon's previous decision to remove content from kindle devices w/o user's permission; here's hoping they learned from that one do's:> improved way to organize content using folders or additional categorization> the ability to browse books by cover> remove the drm> ability to archive a user's book collection on their own computer instead of just on amazon's servers> a way to permanently delete a purchased title, if so desired> book revisions made available for a nominal fee (similar to apple's popular 'complete my album' or 'itunes plus' upgrade programs) > option to 'sign out' or 'buy' books.	1
	(i.e.	1
	$9.99 to purchase and retain the book, $1.99 to sign out for 10 days, after which the lender could choose to renew or purchase the book for an additional fee.	1
	otherwise, it is automatically deleted at the end of the sign-out period.> improved battery life don'ts:> no ads in purchased books!!!!	1
	save the ads for the storefront or free books, but not in books that i purchased.> no charge for wireless downloading of books... ever!	1
	this was a major selling point for me and should not change - if it does, the relationship is over.	1
	(if amazon wishes to collect wireless fees for their 3g service, perhaps they could do so from all those individuals who wish to use the kindle as an internet device instead of an e-book reader)> no touchscreen - i prefer my screen smudge-free and clearly readable.	1
	> no books over $9.99 (w/ perhaps the exception of some of the more expensive text books).	1
	kindle books should remain significantly lower priced than their hardcover counter-parts, or what's the point.      	1
	whole new experience for me.this is my first encounter with any electronic reading device.	1
	i must say i wasn't sure of what to expect from it.	1
	considering that i work in front of my computer for a good amount of hours, i did hesitate wondering if buying it was a good idea for me or not.	1
	what first brought my attention is the non-reflective screen, with this thing with a cute name: e-ink.	1
	i also found out that other devices have the same -or similar- feature.	1
	other things that i consider important in this kindle dx vs. others are: capacity, large screen, text-to-speech feature, compatible formats, connectivity, accelerometer included (change between landscape and portrait).	1
	all of these -and a little bit of bravery... and savings- over weighted the price, so, here i am.	1
	but, am i happy?	1
	well, so far, so good.	1
	i'm studying a master's degree, and it made me very happy to get one of the text books i needed pretty much immediately.	1
	so, in terms of time invested, it is more than i expected.	1
	i still have the whole reading experience to get used to (never read an ebook before), but i'm sure at the end of the day the balance will be favorable.      	1
	take the leap.having purchased over 200 items from amazon, mostly books, i have never felt inspired to comment on a particular product one way or the other.	1
	i have had my kendle dx about a week and a comment is mandatory.	1
	after reading all the comments about it doesn't do this and it doesn't do that, it seems to like this is like looking a gift horse in the mouth.	1
	this is a really unique piece of technology.	1
	to me, the fact that you can download a book or magazine in less than a minute instead of having to order a book and then wait 5 to 7 days to receive it, makes the purchase worthwhile in and of itself even if you had to pay full price for the book not to mention the fact that if you are interested in having the definition of any word that comes along immediately,which i am, then this is a godsend.	1
	there are somethings in life you just can't justify on a price basis.	1
	ask anyone who has paid [...]for a golf cart and they will tell you they could have rented one for about [...] they just wanted their own.	1
	if you like to read then buy this product i can promise you a 100 years from now, it won't make any difference.        	1
	kindle dx.i love the dx, but live in the mountains of nw nc and can only get the sprint signal in certain places about 20 miles away,  when i get connected it is fabulous and my only suggestion would be for the letters on the typewriter key pad to be larger.	1
	i know it wouldn't be as pretty but it certainly would be easier to use.	1
	thanks for your good work  (maybe some tiny stickers could be printed and die cut to fit this first model - you know the model i have now, before you make the ones with bigger buttons and bigger letters!)	1
	excellent tool for students.i'm an eng.	1
	lit.	1
	graduate student, and so far the kindle dx seems to be a good investment.	1
	i got the dx because of the larger screen, which i like, but i haven't explored any other added features.	1
	for the casual reader the original is probably fine.	1
	i read a lot of classic literature, and many of these texts are free for very inexpensive.	1
	if i had to buy all the books i'm responsible for knowing it would cost hundreds of dollars; on my kindle, i will probably spend $30 or so for the same collection.	1
	obviously, i do quite a bit of scholarly writing, and this is the greatest problem i've encountered with the kindle.	1
	publication information is not included with a downloaded book, which makes it useless for papers and articles.	1
	still, i enjoy using my kindle and recommend it, if you can fork out the cash.	1
	if you get one, make sure you get the cover; otherwise you'll obsess on protecting it, since the device itself seems fragile in your hand.      	1
	a nice step up.i bought two dx's about three weeks ago and have to say each is a very nice and well designed piece of hardware.	1
	i did quite a bit of research prior to buying and, as such, have had almost no surprises.	1
	so far everything works as we had hoped and there have been no problems that we couldn't resolve almost immediately.	1
	it's taken a bit of getting used to - no more fingers turning pages, just the button.	1
	and it's so easy switching from one book to another, i've had to practice a bit of self-control as to what i read.	1
	we originally purchased a couple of books in miami using whispernet, which worked like a charm.	1
	as we live overseas, we have since purchased from amazon.com, downloading the books to my computer and then transferring to the kindle.	1
	again, very fast, very easy and no hang-ups whatsoever.	1
	i've also donwloaded a few .pdf's to my kindle with no trouble.	1
	the same week we received our kindles, we took a cruise - what a pleasure 'lugging' around a kindle with five books on it as compared to carrying the same amount of paper.	1
	my only suggestion is to add books to the kindle library as rapidly as possible - especially spanish language novels.	1
	my wife reads only spanish and she loves her kindle, but needs more to read.      	1
	love my kindle almost as much as i love my dog.	1
	great.i bought this for my husband for father's day and it is the best gift i have ever given him.	1
	he uses it all the time and is so excited about it.	1
	i am thrilled with the purchase as is he.      	1
	what  took  so  long.we are a kindle family.	1
	we no longer have to wait for one of us to finish a book before another family member can read it.	1
	we have in the short time we have had them, purchased over 200 books.	1
	as i look at the numerous book shelves in our home, i ask myself  what took so long!	1
	weappreciate the variety of subjects available.	1
	we would have purchased one for the dogs but they are into music.	1
	it is a practical and intelligent`invention.       	1
	only down side is the weight.let me start out by saying i love this device!	1
	it saves me money by downloading the new york times and wall street journal - instead of hard copy versions - and there are no advertisements.	1
	i was reading a ny times article that mentioned a book which i was interested in.	1
	i went to the kindle store and downloaded the book within minutes.	1
	my only reservation is the weight of this kindle.	1
	i often feel i have to choose between the kindle and my laptop when i am loading up my briefcase because the combined weight is too much to be carrying around on a regular basis.      	1
	wow!.i bought this item for my sister for her birthday.	1
	although she is an avid reader, technology passed her by years ago.	1
	i had concerns as to whether she would be able to operate it.	1
	within an hour after receiving it, she called to say that not only could she operate it, but she had already downloaded 17 books.	1
	it is absolutely the best present i have ever given her.      	1
	totally addicted.	1
	when i purchased this kindle, i thought it sounded like a great idea that would make reading more enjoyable.	1
	i had no idea just how much i would love it!	1
	i've been through about seven books in just the last few weeks!	1
	the convienence is incredible.	1
	being able to change the font size is a dream.	1
	the larger dx allows me to make the font bigger without having to change the page too often.	1
	it still fits easily in my handbags.	1
	the battery life is excellent if you make sure to turn the wireless off when you don't need it to download a book.	1
	i've even used the iphone app when i was unexpectedly delayed in a long line.	1
	i was surprised that it was still easily readable and it remembered where i was in the book!!!!!	1
	as far as durability- my 18yr old son walked into my office and sat on it!!	1
	i had it laying on a stool.	1
	i nearly fell over dead, sure that it would be broken, but it was just fine.	1
	i don't reccomend testing this.	1
	i've had an instance to use the dictionary feature and found that useful as well.	1
	i can't imagine going back to regular books anymore.i don't even have to find shelf space to store books i've already read.	1
	the books i've purchased on kindle have all been less expensive than buying the regular bound books and of course- i did't have to wait for delivery or drive to the book store!!!	1
	at the rate i'm reading, it will have paid for itself in no time.	1
	i'm hooked!      	1
	kindle dx.i am a new kindle dx user and could not be more pleased with the experience.	1
	not having previous experience, i cannot validate the complaints regarding what this unit is missing or should not have.	1
	easy to read, easy to drop files into, easy to navigate.	1
	my wish list?	1
	let me alter the fonts on pdf files, allow a file structure on the home page so i can organize my documents, loose the cute screen savers and just let it go 'dark'.	1
	that's about it... by the way, i held off on the original kindle, in spite of my early adopter mentality, due to the small screen size.	1
	mike      	1
	bigger is better, in this case.i've had the kindle dx for nearly a month now, and have compared it to the other kindle models.	1
	here are my thoughts about the kindle dx: -the larger screen is a must have for the avid reader.	1
	one doesn't wish to be scrolling pages every ten seconds because the page is so small; the page size is bigger than a paperback novel - - probably nearly as big as a new release hard cover.	1
	-downloading new books is simple.	1
	turn on the wireless, click on books in the main menu, type in the author's name (or the genre if you are browsing), find the book you want, click on 'buy', and the book is there within 20 - 30 seconds.	1
	no more waiting a week to get a book.	1
	i love finding authors new to me, so when i'm reading a new author, and i decide i really like that author, it takes 15 seconds to find other books by that author - - no more trips to the local bookstore, or ordering from amazon and waiting for the order to arrive!	1
	-i quite often am reading in different places, and the text turns as you turn the kindle dx.	1
	very handy!	1
	-if you turn the wireless off when not in use (very simple to do from the main menu), battery power is greatly enhanced, and a charge will last more than a week even with heavy use.	1
	-the main menu is relatively easy to navigate - - the 5 way button allows you to move up and down the menu, sideways allows you to move forward or backward in the menu.	1
	pressing the button allows you to make a choice.	1
	very intuitive and easy to navigate.	1
	-all pages of every book you purchase are viewable - - cover, table of contents, title pages, acknowledgements, comments from authors or others, everything.	1
	-i download the new york times daily.	1
	it is easy to read, slightly less easy to navigate, but hey, the nyt instantly available every day on the kindle dx.... -the weight and size make the kindle dx a little cumbersome...it's not as light as a single book, but it also never feels 'heavy'.	1
	it's big when you compare to a regular kindle or kindle 2, but its not overly big.	1
	and, when i think of being able to have 20-30 books right there in my hand, given how easy it is to use and read, well, who cares about the weight?!?	1
	last thought:  as mentioned, i've had the kindle dx for just under a month.	1
	the other day, i found a paperback book i had half read on a recent international flight.	1
	i picked it up, thought about it, then put it back down...i realized i much prefer (already!)	1
	reading on the kindle dx!	1
	surprised me.	1
	-      	1
	excellent purchase.very easy to use, large screen, and easy to navigate.	1
	the keyboard is a bit difficult to use, however, making bookmarks somewhat time consuming.	1
	overall, a highly recommended product especially if you are a student (i have all my pdf files on here for my thesis) or tend to carry a ton of books.      	1
	my new kinlde dx.i have now had my kindle dx for the last 2 days and have truly enjoyed every minute.	1
	this was a gift from my husband and one of his best ideas for a gift yet, in the time we have been married.	1
	i love the text size change choices.	1
	i enjoy the larger text while my husband enjoys the smaller.	1
	i love the number of book choices and the down loading of books is so very easy.	1
	i am not a computer person so this feature is fantastic for me.	1
	the easy use displays are very nice.	1
	i have told and shown all of my book buddies and they are jealous.       	1
	i like it...but the problem is we like it....i just bought kindle dx.	1
	both my 9-year-daughter and i like it very much.	1
	it's so convenient to carry your favorite books with only one thing.	1
	now, the issue is we both like it, which shouldn't be a problem.	1
	when she goes to school, i can use it.	1
	when she goes to bed, i can use it.	1
	but, it is a problem because all the books and files are collected without order/folder/organization.	1
	now, we have downloaded more and more books, this issue has become more and more obvious.	1
	i don't understand why this is not done.	1
	the technology should already be there.	1
	look at ipod touch and other devices.	1
	why are these make-people's-lives-easier features not available in such a device most competitive otherwise as a reader?	1
	i don't understand.	1
	please add these features to the next generation.  	1
	kindle dx -- the best yet!.this is the best yet!!!!	1
	i am completely addicted to this great e-reader.	1
	i own a kindle 2 also, and will probably keep both.	1
	i received my new kindle dx yesterday.	1
	it arrived on time as advertised!	1
	i love the landscape view!	1
	i was also pleased to see that my archived items and purchases were immediately available on both devices -- it was almost transparent.	1
	my only criticism is that i wish it was a bit lighter and had color.	1
	i also wish newspapers were more complete -- they lack comics and other various items like photos.	1
	but i have faith that in the near future we will see color and better photo display on the kindle.      	1
	lovin' the dx.i am a k1 owner for the past year and now a proud new dx owner.	1
	yes, it's bigger, but that means more text/page and better graphics.	1
	i love that it hold about 3500 books, the rotation thing is cool, and to me, as a k1 owner and not a k2 owner, is that it's a total upgrade.	1
	pdf highlighting would be nice, though, but not essential for me.	1
	admittedly, i a complete book horder and this device allows me to have as many books as i can afford in one convenient place.	1
	no more bookshelf purchases for me!	1
	sure wish people without this device would stop reviewing it, though.       	1
	a specialized reader.	1
	my b-day present.i received my kindle as a b-day presie - wow!	1
	delivery was amazingly fast and personalised, the moment i switched on my kindle, it was already addressed to me!	1
	i'm very happy with my new 'book of books'.	1
	i have also been able to give most of my book collection to our college and it's being held in the headmistress' office for teachers to share and enjoy.	1
	and it's freed up plenty shelf space in my home.	1
	there are some books which i still prefer to purchase as paper copies, like crafts books because they're in colour and it just adds to the entire project having the methods displayed in colour.	1
	would be great to see this incorporated into kindle.	1
	as i live in portugal the web browsing functionality is not good - i think this needs to be worked on asap.	1
	also, the music function is restricted to mp3, most of my ipod music is in aac format so i have to convert it in order to play it on my kindle.	1
	there's also no way of working through the music other than the alt+spacebar or alt+f key.	1
	perhaps include itunes or something similar, i love reading with soft background music and this is an added bonus as i can choose what i want to listen to and not what my family is listening to and i don't need another gadget to play my music, it's all in one on my kindle.	1
	love my kindle and recommend it!      	1
	love it!.i am a book junkie.	1
	i never thought i'd like the kindle.	1
	i do!	1
	it's great.	1
	i still go to bookstores but now i just write down the titles i want to read.	1
	there are several websites that offer free kindle books too.      	1
	suspect global coverage.i love my kindle.	1
	i travel extensively and the kindle has saved me a huge amount of money due to weight requirements for baggage these days.	1
	i was a little surprised when i opened my kindle recently in bali only to find it had no coverage at all.	1
	i've been here for 3 months and traveled the island extensively.	1
	no coverage.	1
	its funny though, amazon's coverage chart has bali covered completely.	1
	makes me wonder the authenticity of the coverage chart as a whole.	1
	again, i love this product i just wish their coverage chart was more accurate.	1
	jv	1
	regular.hola: bueno, me compr un kindle dx hace un mes ms o menos y est bien aunque echo de menos algunas caractersticas.	1
	en primer lugar, es algo caro.	1
	creo que vas a pagar como yo la primada.	1
	en segundo lugar, a m personalmente me gustara ms que organizara los libros por orden alfabtico de forma automtica porque cuando metes muchos libros resulta catica su bsqueda navegando por todo el ndice (aunque tenga buscador).	1
	por otro lado, sera de agradecer que pudiera utilizarse una tarjeta de memoria externa.	1
	si quieres tener una biblioteca dentro de tu kindle el espacio es limitado.	1
	tambin el nivel de contraste se podra mejorar, no es que no sea bueno, pero, en condiciones de poca luz es difcil leer.por lo dems, el tamao de la ventana es ptimo y  su manejo es cmodo en cualquier situacin.	1
	ah, otra cosa.	1
	podan haber puesto los accesorios un poco ms baratos porque despus de gastarte lo que te gastas en el aparatito parece que quieren sangrante con las fundas y dems.pues espero que os valga para algo este comentario.      	1
	scholar disappointed.	1
	kindle review from a technologist viewpoint.i am a heavy reader.	1
	much of my workday is spend reading - normally on a computer screen.	1
	during my leisure hours i consume both technology books, non-fiction and novels.	1
	frequently i spend more hours in a day reading than i do sleeping - i don't sleep much.	1
	when  not reading, i am often composing, designing, or architecting systems - again staring into a computer screen.	1
	needless to say, i suffer from frequent eye strain.	1
	the computer monitor backlighting takes a heavy toll on my over 40 eyes.	1
	enter the kindle.	1
	i was attracted to the kindle because of its 'e-ink screen' display.	1
	having used the kindle dx for a month now, i can tell you it is easy on the eyes.	1
	it really is just as easy on the eyes as paper.	1
	after a long day of abusing my eyes, i can relax with a good book on the kindle and simply enjoy.	1
	i can also move pdfs, blogs and other technology or work related documents from my computer onto the kindle and read without the normal eye stress.	1
	i am on the road frequently, so when i do need to unwind with a novel, i can search, purchase and be reading in a few short minutes.	1
	these were the primary reason i bought the kindle and it has fully met my expectations.	1
	i give it a 5 star rating in this regard.	1
	ok; having met my primary needs, i will succumb to human nature and consider my secondary needs - let the whining commence... regarding novels or other non-photo intensive pleasure books, i really have no complaints.	1
	i do have a single concern; 20 years from now, how do i re-read one of the books that i am buying for the kindle today.	1
	not having the answer to this question, has already caused me to delay a couple purchases.	1
	regarding technology books, the kindle really only adequately addresses one of my three main use cases;  initial reading of the book to get an overview of the technology.	1
	if you are a technologist, you are used to constantly balancing trade-off to find the best solution.	1
	as an overview reader, the kindle is great regarding ready access to materials, physical space requirements, briefcase travel weight, as well as the easy on your eyes quality described above.	1
	it is a little slow with page refreshes for speed reading and the highlighter is not as efficient as using my yellow marker in a paper book, but overall i would rate it 4 stars.	1
	where the kindle really lacks is in the other two use cases:  using the book as a quick reference, and copying code for use in building sample applications.	1
	first the quick reference;  when i am learning a new technology, i highlight the book, sticky-note bookmark key sections, and frequently flip back and forth aiding my absorption.	1
	the kindle has similar constructs and capabilities, but the speed in which you can navigate is radically slower.	1
	so much slower that it is a real barrier to effective use.	1
	many technology books also include a pdf, on cd or downloadable, which also allows a more rapid key word search and navigation than using the kindle.	1
	this speed issue is so significant to my methods of learning, that i would have to rate this capability as 2 stars.	1
	regarding copying sample source code from the book:  once again the kindle offers a way to mark text in the book, clip the text into a separate file and then copy this file to your computer, and finally search the text in this clipping file for your specific sample code.	1
	due to the timing and complexity, this is not really a practical sequence.	1
	of course, if you have a paper book you will have even less options (scan plus ocr).	1
	but as mentioned before, many technology books include the pdf for the book or at least the sample code.	1
	in its current state, i would rate the kindle a 1 star in this capability.	1
	fortunately, amazon can easily solve this problem.	1
	if you purchase a book that normally includes a cd with the pdf, and you buy the kindle version then also include the pdf in the download.	1
	a final note: most of the shortcomings of the kindle for my use with technology books can be easily solved by including a kindle reader for the mac (and i guess the windows guys can have one too).	1
	in fact, if the kindle version had the same sync ability between the kindle and mac, then the solution would be far superior to the paper book plus pdf version, since bookmarks and clippings could also be synced.	1
	it is rumored that this is on the way - so at least for now i will continue to purchase tech books on the kindle with a cautious eye towards the kindle reader for mac release dates.	1
	i feel compelled to rate the kindle dx 5 stars overall since it did completely meet my primary expectations, and i expect my primary concerns to be addressed by the future kindle reader for mac product.	1
	if the mac version of the reader was not on the horizon, i would rate the kindle dx 5 stars for pleasure reading and 2 stars overall for technology reading.	1
	[...]      	1
	why did i wait so long?.my sister had been after me for several years to get a kindle.	1
	when the new dx came out i couldn't resist any longer.	1
	i haven't read so much and so fast for years.	1
	my eyes are 7 years older than my sister's and i prefer the dx over the smaller version for that reason.	1
	i dearly love my new kindle dx and i am delighted that i finally listened to her advice!      	1
	'wow a huge ipod!!	1
	'.this is my first experience with a kindle, actually with any e-reader.	1
	so far i love it.	1
	when i opened the box my 7 year old nephew looked at it and exclaimed 'wow a huge ipod!'	1
	and you know he is right, this is a huge ipod, for books.	1
	i wanted a kindle 2 but i waited to buy the kindle dx because i thought i would like the bigger screen size, the pdf capabilities and the auto rotate and..... i do.	1
	but i have to admit i was a little intimidated by the size.	1
	it doesn't fit into a normal size purse, but i am sure i will regularly carry it with me.	1
	the screen is awesome.	1
	like some of the other buyers i thought the welcome screen was a sticker!	1
	bravo amazon!!	1
	the only con i have is that you have to pay $49.99 for a decent case.	1
	for the price of the unit and all the books we will all eventually download they really need to include the leather case.	1
	i ended up buying the leather case (which i really like) and an additional pouch to put the whole thing in.	1
	$489 is a big investment and i want to double protect this bad boy!	1
	!  	1
	hardly any science and textbooks  for e-readers, kindle or nook!.	1
	loved my kindle until i found out this ....................................if your kindle dx breaks, loose it, gets stolen or you upgrade from kindle 2 or kindle 1 all your newspaper and magazine issues will be unreadable on the replacement or new kindle.	1
	first, amazon does not archive newspaper and magazine issues in your account for more that a few issues unlike when you purchase books.	1
	it is up to you to back up nps and magazines onto your computer to archive.	1
	(for example the wall street journal) here is the rub.	1
	should you loose, receive a replacement kindle dx (warranty or otherwise) or purchase a kindle dx as an upgrade, all past issues of newspapers or magazines that were downloaded to the original kindle will be unreadable on any subsequent kindle even though it is registered to your account.	1
	think about this for a moment.	1
	you buy these periodicals and obtain the rights for your use, but if you purchase or replace your kindle you have no further rights to read past issues you bought and paid for.	1
	one better hope that their kindle never breaks because amazon does not repair your kindle they replace it with another.	1
	therefore no more use of your periodicals.	1
	sound absurd?	1
	well it is true.	1
	so much for a reference library.	1
	on one hand you can purchase a hard copy of a magazine or newspaper and let 1000 people read it, but now it turns out you can't even read a copy of the very one you purchased.	1
	this may be a narrow issue but important to some users.	1
	after all i did buy and pay for the subscription and if i take the time to archive myself it makes no sense that when my kindle is replaced, which i am in the midst of, the archived periodicals become useless.	1
	imagine the outrage if this were the case with kindle books you purchased.	1
	backed up copies of periodicals can only be read on the kindle that they were originally downloaded to.	1
	if you buy a newer version of a kindle or your kindle is replaced by amazon, backed up copies are not able to be read on the replacement or newer kindle model.	1
	absurd but true!	1
	it is because of the digital rights management (drm) that is embedded in the file of the periodical.	1
	it records the serial number of the original kindle that the periodical was downloaded to.	1
	if you change kindles, of course the serial number changes and therefore the file is unusable on the new or replacement kindle.	1
	(this is not the case with books) for all the good that has come out of kindle it amazes me some of the stupidity that has been built in to this policy.	1
	i know that the great majority of purchasers of kindle love them, and the ability to read books and periodicals this way.	1
	i am one of those customers.	1
	but at the same time i have come to realize that if one points out a legitmate problem that kindle has, that some purchasers become offended.	1
	i am not bashing the kindle.	1
	only telling the story of what i think is an unfair situation, that is not typical on how amazon usually does business. 	1
	not what i expected.i got my kindle dx today.	1
	it is the first kindle i have ever dealt with.	1
	i bought it because i hate sitting and reading software manuals (usually in pdf) format in front of the screen when they have 200 to 300 pages.	1
	i'd rather stretch out on a couch and browse them.	1
	another reason is to see how well the ebooks i have created will look on the kindle.	1
	i tend to use color pictures and i really want to see them on a gray scale device.	1
	i haven't tried this yet.	1
	well the first thing i tried was to download a small pdf into the dx.	1
	upon plugging in the usb cable it appeared everything was ok.  i dragged a small pdf file onto the kindle directory and disaster struck.	1
	not only did the kindle freeze so did my computer.	1
	i was forced to reboot by turning my computer off.	1
	this is a modern 64-bit ibm pc running win xp professional.	1
	it has uptodate software patches.	1
	getting the kindle to reset wasn't easy either.	1
	i'm not sure what happened but eventually it decided to reboot itself.	1
	after about an hour of futile activity i went to another computer and tried downloading from it.	1
	it is an older 32 bit windows xp media edition, and i tried putting the same file on the kindle -- this worked fine just like the manual said it would.	1
	conclusion amazon did not check this device out with win xp 64-bit, which is the primary machine i work on.	1
	my next trial was with the amazon kindle store.	1
	this worked find for browsing and downloading a sample of a book.	1
	but i found the prices of most new books much too high.	1
	i did buy a $1 roget's to try out downloading a book.	1
	that worked just fine.	1
	i was unhappy with the displayed font size on pdf files and felt hampered by not being able to change the display size or to zoom the frame.	1
	this kills my plans for browsing manuals.	1
	the pdf reader in the kindle is just too primitive, it is not ready for prime time.	1
	next i tried searching wikipedia for things and discovered that both google and wikipedia just claimed to have errors when i tried to access them.	1
	then i tried going to my own website and it failed as well.	1
	it seems i am limited to accessing the kindle shop on the wispernet.	1
	i have no idea why it is acting this way.	1
	being a new user maybe i am doing something stupid but the steps seem pretty obvious.	1
	this is a big failure.	1
	things i do like about the kindle dx is the quality of the screen and the clarity of the print.	1
	i am not overly enthusiastic about the human interface.	1
	i think more work should have been put into deciding how i should access the built in dictionary.	1
	it is probably not high on my list of things i might want to do with text and yet it pushes itself on you if you like it or not.	1
	if i keep the kindle maybe i'll get used to this. 	1
	does not support all pdfs.i purchased the kindle dx as i was excited about the native pdf ability.	1
	i own a sony reader but enlarging the text for pdf documents does not always work out well.	1
	however, what the kindle dx product description doees not mention is that it does not support all pdf documents.	1
	most of my ebook library would not work on the kindle dx because the kindle does not support pdf digital(drm)documents.	1
	though i loved the bigger screen and rotation.	1
	i was disappointed in the kindle dx in that there was no way to organize the books and not all pdf documents are supported.	1
	i sent the kindle dx back.        	1
	sadly, won't buy kindle dx.living in australia my wife and i were delighted to discover that the kindledx was finally available globally as, with a home library of at least 4000 books and a growth rate of 250-350 books per annum, we are starting to run out of shelf space.	1
	we also travel quite a bit.	1
	and being able to buy a book directly from the device, in a large number of countries worldwide, without having to actually go to a shop or log in to a computer is an added incentive.	1
	but sadly we won't be buying the kindledx.	1
	why?	1
	the showstopper was the limited number of books available in the australian region.	1
	we compared a list of all 155 books that we had purchased in the past six months with what was available from amazon.	1
	we were shocked to discover that only 34 (22%) were available to australians.	1
	a further 35 (23%) were available in the usa region.	1
	that still leaves well over 50% that would not have been able to be purchased for the kindle.	1
	our selection was eclectic, non-fiction and fiction (classics, popular, crime, thriller, sci-fi, romance, historical).	1
	most were in small paperback format (ie not the latest releases from some authors), a few were trade paperbacks and some hard-cover.	1
	i was even more surprised by the number of popular authors who are not available in ebook.	1
	despite this, we still might have been tempted but we had some other concerns.	1
	size/weight is one issue.	1
	my wife is a very fast reader and we had already decided that the size of the screen on the kindle2 could be frustratingly small, especially if there is a noticeable delay in loading the next page.	1
	so the kindledx seemed ideal with its lovely big screen but the device is too heavy, especially when you add in the weight of a protective cover.	1
	we both regularly carry books with us wherever we go, either in back-packs where size isn't too critical, or more often in a handbag/shoulder bag where the kindledx size and weight becomes a problem.	1
	my wife says she feels like goldilocks!	1
	the kindle2 is too small and the kindledx is too big but there isn't one that is just right (a 7.5-8 inch screen would probably be ideal).	1
	another issue that concerns us is the apparent fragility of the kindledx.	1
	as mentioned above we take books everywhere and any ereader has to be able to stand up to being carted around and pulled in and out of bags.	1
	and cope with the rigors of travel by plane, train, car, bus or boat.	1
	my wife would love to not have to lug kilos of books with her when going on holiday, especially to places where she knows she is not going to be able to easily buy more books, but just the thought of having an ereader die at the start of a holiday leaving her with nothing to read for days or weeks is also a deterrent to purchasing the kindle.	1
	the final major issue is the life of the ebook or elibrary.	1
	our current library contains some books that we have owned for well over 30 years and they are reread on occasion (we reread books regularly).	1
	will we still be able to reread the ebooks that we have purchased in 10 or 20 years time?	1
	will publishing disputes result in ebooks being summarily removed from our personal elibrary as has already happened to many people who bought certain orwell editions?	1
	will new generations of ereader be backward-compatible for formats or, alternatively, will our elibraries be automatically updated to new formats (can't see this happening actually)?	1
	we would hate to invest thousands of dollars in ebooks to find that we can't reread them in the future.	1
	minor issues include amazon not supplying a power adaptor for australian purchases - the whole point of an ebook is to be independent of a computer; the initial cost including protective covers and extended warranties that appear to be almost mandatory given the fragility of the device and the insistence by amazon that any problems are because the customer has done something wrong (takes me back 15-20 years to the bad-old early days of technology); and the cost of ebooks in the australian region - certainly cheaper than paper books but not if the books don't have shelf life.	1
	sadly we guess we'll have to wait a bit longer for elibraries, until the technology is mature, robust and stable and the international copyright issues have been resolved so that all books are available world-wide.	1
	we may reconsider the kindle2 as a travel ereader (more research required) but definitely won't be buying the kindledx.	1
	simply amazing in all respects.	1
	my new bff.	1
	can't wait for kindle dx2.this is my first kindle, i love it, but i am already anticipating the dx2.	1
	what i love about my kindle: it is easy to read, it is easy to download a book, it is easy to transfer a pdf to the kindle, it reads my acrobat files, and it stores lots of books.	1
	the kindle will pay for itself just because i am now able to read free download books (pdf) on a convienent reader.	1
	usually what i have to do is print these books and put them in binders or buy the bound book.	1
	i do not regret buying the kindle dx.	1
	what i don't like about my kindle: it is too expensive--honestly you can buy a regular laptop for the $500.	1
	the keyboard sucks--if you are going to make a qwerty keyboard then do it, don't combine rows--i have seen better keyboards on a cellphone.	1
	it lacks any kind of folder system--my god, if anyone ever did put 3500 books on this thing it would take hours to page through just all the titles.	1
	no memory card--how sweet it would be to be able to put groups of books, documents, and pdfs on cheap little memory cards.	1
	so if you are planning on buying the kindle make sure it meets your requirements--it meets mine--otherwise you might be disappointed.      	1
	dx not ready for prime time.	1
	not expensive, not even close to being expensive.	1
	kindle dx still needs some work................the new kindle dx;  the kindle is great!	1
	but it does need improving for the price.	1
	cons;  the weight of the dx is too heavy for one handed reading.	1
	the pdf reader function should allow the dictionary function to be used.	1
	why have a dictionary if u can't access it during the read?	1
	also, it seems the more books you have in the kindle dx the more battery power it takes, depleting it ever 3 or 4 days if you have a lot of books stored.	1
	i ran a test and stored 730 books on the kindle dx and wow it ate up the battery, so if you thinking about using it to store all your books, oh say 2,500 books or so, be prepared to charge it.	1
	and it slows it down a lot while its trying to access all those books.	1
	the rotating screen was ignoring for me, because with this big heavy thing i find myself shifting it around alot and oops, there goes the screen, so i keep that turn on protrait only.	1
	and now for the pros, well the pros they advertise those, lol.       	1
	kindledx: color conversions on pdf.i just received my dx.	1
	i am a prior kindle and current kindle2 user.	1
	why did i buy the dx?	1
	i purchased it primarily to read technical programming books which are so frequently distributed in pdf format now.	1
	reading technical books in the kindle/kindle2 frequently did not work well because diagrams and code snippets were virtually unreadable.	1
	the first book that i tried to read on the dx was a programming book on the android platform, 'hello, android' by ed burnette.	1
	it was amazingly easy to copy the pdf from my computer to the kindle and the reading experience on the dx was much better than on the kindle2; however, there is an issue when a book uses a lot of different colors in its text.	1
	in the case of this book, they had to make serious revisions for the latest version of android.	1
	as a result, they used color to denote revised sections.	1
	unfortunately, some of the colors are so light when translated to gray scale that they are very difficult to read.	1
	so, the lack of color on the electronic 'ink' strikes again.      	1
	big, uncomfortable, and overall odd.just got my kindle dx today, i am new to using a kindle and was so excited about getting a dx every time i heard somebody drive down the road i ran out to see if it was ups.	1
	it finally came... one thing i have to complement is how exquisitely lovely it was packaged, i got excited opening it up!	1
	i plug it in, put it in it's cover (the standard amazon black leather cover, that is in no way shape or form worth $45.00 but does have a handy magnet).	1
	now it's time to turn it on and get to reading.	1
	the highest praise i can give it is the display is easy to look at and the page turns don't take to awful long.	1
	the problem is this, it's uncomfortable to hold.	1
	i can't exactly put my finger on what's wrong with it, but to me it's just not right.	1
	i used it for a bit, reading the getting started guide and set it aside, i thought i would let it charge unplug it and attempt to get comfy reading it tonight, but i am relatively sure it's going to get returned really soon.	1
	it's just not comfortable to use.        	1
	great concept, disappointing device.	1
	love it.	1
	i didn't think i would like a kindle until i tried one.i love reading my paperback books and never thought i would want to give them up for an electronic copy.	1
	the kindle dx has completely changed my mind.	1
	it really does read just like a paper page and i am enjoying having multiple titles available to me at any time.	1
	i am now on my 4th kindle book (all free so far) and don't reget this purchase in the least.	1
	a kindle is definitely worth the investment if you enjoying reading.      	1
	great device.i really love my new kindle dx.	1
	it's great for traveling.	1
	instead of taking along several books on my vacation, i can now download what i want to read and off we go!	1
	i can even load a pdf containing my travel documents on my kindle.	1
	color would be nice; if a book or document contained a graphic or colored text.      	1
	i love my kindle!!!	1
	!.although some improvements are needed, i can say that i love my kindle, it has helped me in a couple of days regain my love for reading, specially now that i'm in the final stage of my ph.d and i was just so overwhelmed by documents and papers, and now that is all in the past as i have all my documents on my kindle.i think that amazon and kindle developers need to work more in collaboration with the adobe company in order to develop the abilities of the kindle to deal with pdf files, specially to add notes at least, that is something that its causing me trouble now.	1
	but in general i can say that i'm very satisfied with the product, and the size of the dx is just perfect, i'm glad i decided to buy that one instead of the kindle 2 which i think is too small for my needs.well i definitely recommend it, and just started to do so with my friends, although to some of them the price is quite high, in my case i cannot say because it was a gift from my mother.	1
	but i love it, it is the best gift!	1
	!.       	1
	bigger is better for technical books.i have used the 1st kindle for a year and a half and really love it.	1
	the only down side was that i couldn't read some of my technical books.	1
	the problem was with the images and tables that didn't fit the size of the original kindle.	1
	the larger size of the kindle dx allows me to carry my reference books and read them with ease.	1
	i have used my original kindle for all my recreational reading every day since i purchased it.	1
	i will now be using the kindle dx for all my recreational reading and for all my technical reading.	1
	i was just looking around my library and realizing all the room i will save when i donate my books to the library.	1
	(i'll also be saving a lot of trees in the future.)	1
	oh and i gave my wife my orignal kindle.	1
	she was dead set against purchasing a kindle.	1
	now she can't put it down.	1
	protective case: i purchased the kindle dx cover with the kindle dx.	1
	however i wanted more protection for the kindle dx when i carry it in my backpack.	1
	targus makes a netbook slipskin peel mini-notebook case that fits up to a 10.2' widescreen netbook which fits the kindle dx in it's cover like a glove. 	1
	price increase on titles.i'm an avid library user who travels several times a year and have been waiting for kindle like devices to evolve and was just about to purchase one when i read about the pending price increases for book titles to $14.99.	1
	the convenience of owning a kindle rather than packing several books on my next cruise is no longer of interest to me since the publishing houses now know they can demand higher prices and amazon will cave in.	1
	the sky caps and bell hops can carry my heavier suitcases and i wont feel like i'm a captive subject to sporadic price increases.	1
	i want the authors and publishing staff that aid them to receive fair payments for their craft, however, the cost savings in printing, shipping, middleman bookstore costs, etc.	1
	must be a significant part of book cost that is avoided with e books.	1
	if it was working at $9.99 or less per title why the need to charge more?	1
	i guess i'll continue to be an active library user.	1
	the publishers should be looking at the demise of print newspapers and trying to get out ahead of the same fate that will embrace them rather than resisting with higher costs.           	1
	for periodicals?	1
	not worth it..i bought my kindle dx primarily for casual reading of periodicals & newspapers.	1
	1. generally, the content (meaning words only) are there.	1
	sometimes, articles are just left out.2.	1
	the table of contents tend to be the only good way to find what you want to read.	1
	so, you can surf by article but this is cumbersome on a kindle and not as easy as a physical magazine.3.	1
	the look and feel of a periodical has a lot to do with the fonts, illustrations, pictures and even the ads.	1
	most periodicals don't include any of these in their kindle subscriptions.	1
	those that do, just include a little snippet.	1
	so, anything remotely art or style related is unusable on a kindle.	1
	the text is a straight text file style text.	1
	nothing even close to what a webpage may be able to offer.4.	1
	given that amazon takes a % from periodical publishers, this often causes pricing to be more expensive.	1
	the wsj kindle subscription is significantly more than their online subscription.	1
	you can in fact get online + physical for slightly less than a kindle subscription.	1
	5. a great deal is made about being able to subscribe to blogs which are normally free.	1
	yet, since amazon wants its cut, they aren't free on the kindle.6.	1
	digital content e-magazines are in their infancy.	1
	i get it.	1
	it's not ready for prime time yet.	1
	that's why some of my favorite magazines aren't even available... wired, hbr, dwell.	1
	it seems only the business ones fair in appearance-- wsj, financial times.7.	1
	i'm paying $500 to read periodicals which are inferior to the ones on the news stands or subscriptions.	1
	the only thing i get is that these periodicals are instantly sent to me over whispernet wherever i go.	1
	i think my dx is going back.      	1
	quality from amazon.	1
	now, this is a money-saving device!.	1
	start of the revolution.i'm a writer and while some have been slow to accept the kindle, i'm more than ready.	1
	after two months with the dx, i can't say i'd change anything.	1
	yes, the price is high and that will keep some people away, but you know what - you get what you pay for.	1
	there's the occasional book that i wish was available, but 90% of the time it's there, it's cheaper than hardback, and pow - whispernet puts it on the device in seconds.	1
	the big screen is the selling point for me.	1
	my best friend has an original kindle and i wasn't fond of the small screen size.	1
	i read fast and with that, it was click click click and it felt like it was slowing me down.	1
	with the dx, the big swath of screen allows me to really get into the experience of reading rather than dealing with the technology.	1
	you'll quickly forget that you're dealing with a device rather than just reading.	1
	i guess if you like the feel or want leatherbound books in your mahogany paneled library, kindle's not for you.	1
	neither is the 21st century.	1
	what i want is the ability to read the best books in the best way, whenever and wherever i might be.	1
	oh look ... i carried thirty books with me as i went from my desk over to the patio.	1
	let's see you do that with your old books.	1
	you know what feature i love that meant nothing to me originally?	1
	the integrated dictionary.	1
	even the smartest of us will come across a word in a book and go 'huh?'	1
	click click - i just learned a new word.	1
	the screen's clarity is great.	1
	the keyboard ... eh, but you won't mind because there's really few occasions to use it and it's good enough for those.	1
	the speakers, same thing - good enough.	1
	size?	1
	i think that's love or hate.	1
	i like the big size, but if you think it's too much, the kindle 2 is for you.	1
	the biggest deciding factor for me was the pdf support.	1
	this year's 'football outsiders almanac' -- to which i am a contributor -- was available as a pdf download and carrying that monster of a book with me to radio gigs or events was always a hassle.	1
	now?	1
	it's just another file, perfectly readable with all the charts and graphs.	1
	i can't wait to see my next book on there.	1
	is the kindle dx for everyone?	1
	no.	1
	it's expensive and for early adopters willing to accept that there's a cost involved with being on the leading edge.	1
	it might be a bit big for some.	1
	i'm still very unsure about newspapers on the kindle.	1
	for everything else, this truly is a revolutionary device that has done exactly what i hoped for and one more thing - it's reminded me how great it is to read, to be lost in the works of great writers, and made it possible for me to read more.	1
	that's worth the price and then some.      	1
	needs a few tweaks!!!	1
	!.for the money, the kindle dx is just ok!	1
	i like the idea of having a library that i can take anywhere.	1
	it's very readable.	1
	on the other hand -- 1.  the power cord is very cheaply made and after about 2-3 mos of use falls out of the connection.	1
	there are some after-market cords that are much better.	1
	buy one of these!!!	1
	2.  diagrams and pictures are fair to poor at best.	1
	be careful of 'how to...' books; it's hard to follow along if you're using pictures and diagrams to follow along instructions.	1
	3.  the 'designed for kindle' leather cover which hooks directly into the device actually breaks the kindle.	1
	don't buy it!!!	1
	(especially since amazon does not consider the breakage 'under warranty.'	1
	very convnient but expensive to read newspapers.i like everything about kindle.	1
	the only problem is the price for the subscription especially for newspapers like wsj and ny times.	1
	while the publishers saved the price of the print and delivery they have not passed the savings to the consumers.	1
	also some of the newspapers are available free on the internet and makes you wonder why one would pay for it to get it on kindle. 	1
	wish i had gotten the kindle sooner!.	1
	happy about it for just two days.at the first two days, i was happy that i no longer needed to bring big books everywhere.	1
	then i have a 3000 pages pdf book loaded and it takes 5 min to page back and forth.	1
	i am so disappointed about the device.      	1
	kindle dx - buyer beware....	1
	dx international review.generally quite happy with the dx as an e-reader.	1
	weight, size, fonts etc all deliver.a bit disappointing that there are really limited features, like no page numbers, no clock while reading, limited books available.	1
	also other features seem quite hidden and need expert key strokes to reveal.also international newspapers are limited and why can't we get pictures in newspapers outside if the us?very expensive if used only as a replacement for books - to ammortise the $500 one needs to buy heaps of books @ the reduced price to make it worthwhile financially, and then you lose the ability to pass that old novel over to a friend.	1
	kindle 2 may be your better option.in general, i like it.	1
	the instant access to books, newspaper, blogs makes me hard to quit reading.	1
	the big screen makes reading more enjoyable.	1
	however, after a few days, i readlly wish i bought the kindle2.	1
	here is my reasons: 1. too heavy.	1
	i'd like to hold it with one hand while i am lying down reading, but after a while, it's very tiring.	1
	if my arm can't grow stronger, i wish the device is lighter.	1
	2. pdf support is not that great.	1
	i read lots of computer mannuls, this is one of the major features i was excited about.	1
	however, i can't increase font size like a normal kindle format, it makes my pdf file or pdf formatted e-book hard to read.	1
	in other words, i could not take advantage of the big screen.	1
	3. can't print.	1
	maybe i am too new to kindle world, but i really can't find a way to print pages of a book nor a newspaper article, nor pdf pages.	1
	4. the borwser sucks, even with the js feature turned on.	1
	if a similar browser as ie or firefox is added, i wouldn't even consider a upgrade to ipad.	1
	5. hard to organize reading materials.	1
	can i create folders, amazon?	1
	with all the above complaints, why should i spend $220+ more for dx, but i really like the way it delivers most reading materials.	1
	i wish there is something like amazon store, where i can test out its products.   	1
	fun.i purchased this only a couple of days ago and i gotta say i love it!	1
	i absolutely love it!      	1
	2 dead dxs.i've just returned my second dx because of charging problems.	1
	the first one sometimes would charge and sometimes wouldn't.	1
	amazon replaced it with no hassle, and the replacement unit worked for a couple months.	1
	this morning it showed a critical battery screen and would not charge, period.	1
	i spent the obligatory 15 minutes on the phone with amazon kindle support before the rep agreed the unit was dead and got another one on the way.	1
	the dx does a fine job on the specialized use i bought it for (displaying aviation instrument approach charts when i'm flying), but the poor reliability forces me to give it a failing grade.      	1
	kindle dx and the ipad.okay i am an avid reader and a mac user.	1
	my husband bought me the dx for christmas.	1
	i love it but as a self proclaimed techie i instantly saw the drawbacks to this device.	1
	let me also say i have an ipod touch with the kindle app but it is so tiny and at 40 these eyes just couldn't cut it.	1
	i still love my touch.	1
	the first thing i didn't like about the dx is the lack of color.	1
	i do love the kindle don't get me wrong.	1
	but if you buy a children's book and i teach and have young children, color would be nice.	1
	i don't like the fact that i cannot buy more than one book at a time.	1
	i don't like that the search box doesn't remember what i have previously searched.	1
	i do love the wireless.	1
	i love the amazingly glare proof screen.	1
	i love the rotate feature and i think the keyboard is great.	1
	i like the bigger size again because of the eyes.	1
	i would still like to get the ipad and compare.	1
	whichever i liked least would go to my college-age son.	1
	:-) any way you look at it these devices are great.	1
	the potential for the college world and all education is phenomenal.	1
	i can see every student carrying this instead of books.       	1
	amazing device.this device is nothing short of astounding.	1
	i received mine as a birthday gift and i couldn't be happier.	1
	the e-ink technology is impressive; the pictures of the kindle don't really do it justice, you have to see it firsthand to understand why its light years ahead of lcd screens.	1
	i subscribed to the boston globe and newsweek and canceled my physical subscriptions.	1
	this is so much easier, especially when taking it on the subway.	1
	downloading books is painless; you don't need to hook the device up to your computer - wireless seems to be available anywhere, and the books download really fast.	1
	the prices in the kindle store are reasonable ($9.99 at present for most books) especially when you take into account the ease and convenience factor.	1
	the only real cons i can think of for the kindle is that it's a bit on the heavy side and it does seem to be delicate.	1
	i'm glad amazon is sticking to its guns and not trying to make this thing into an ipad or a netbook - that's not something i need or want.       	1
	best reader out there.	1
	i am in haven.	1
	my kindle dx.just got the kindle dx and i love it.	1
	its so easy to use.	1
	helpful guide that will assist you in learning the new buttons.	1
	downloaded 2 books and it took about 10 sec each to download.	1
	i'm an ardent reader and normally read about 3 to 5 books a week.	1
	i have stacks and stacks of book, normally i end up donating them to the local library.	1
	now i can have all the books i like and want on my kindle.	1
	if you love to read as much as i do, i would recommend kindle dx, it will pay for itself, especially when your not having to spend 20+ dollars on a hardcover because the book hasn't come out in paperback yet.	1
	the books i downloaded, one i paid 4.95 and the second book 5.00 for the download.	1
	well worth it.        	1
	global wireless after only 6 months of new dx kindle?.love my kindle but...disappointed that a global version has been released with little notification when i bought my dx that this option was in the pipleine.       	1
	i love it !.my husband has the sony reader.	1
	i was impressed with his until i got mine.	1
	i absolutely love my kindle.	1
	i would reccomend every reader buy a kindle.	1
	fast, easy , and affordable.       	1
	kindle dx.	1
	love the kindle dx.	1
	the reader.	1
	couldn't be happier.	1
	enjoying my kindle!.	1
	kindle dx review.	1
	you will love this kindle~ how did i live without it?	1
	?.i thought my first dell comp was pretty cool some 12 yrs ago but it was nothing compared to how much i truly love my kindle dx.	1
	i have always wished for an electronic reader; even as a child i remember thinking how neat it would be if books could read to you when you got tired of reading yourself.	1
	and the weight of books, the hassle of turning pages especially in bed without tearing the sheets, the pain of having to round up your books before settling in to read, these problems are gone!!	1
	i was taught as a child to read my bible every night, even after reading whatever novels or school books i had to go over, but every bible i've ever owned had paper thin sheets and that always bugged me.	1
	i know it's petty but having the bible on my kindle dx was so worth the price; eyelids feel heavy, turn on the text-to-speech and follow along or let her read to me; i tell you, folks, it is a dream come true for me, and i've never read as much or as long and learned so much since i've bought this product.	1
	i bought the leather holder, ear buds and the mighty lite and downloaded all the classics (free!!!	1
	)and many others that i have enjoyed so much.	1
	my first to read was beautiful joe by marshall saunders.	1
	it has become one of my most favorites and i'm sure not only because of the precious story but because it was so wonderful reading it on my dx.	1
	going online is so cool, the battery lasts forever before it needs charging, the way you can rotate it around to fit your lap or tray or bed; it is just so fabulous, i can't recommend it enough.	1
	you will not be disappointed!	1
	it is the perfect gift for anyone who loves to read, or for anyone you want to encourage to read more.      	1
	wishing it had one more feature..........	1
	great product....	1
	wow what a machine.the kindle has far exceeded my expectations.	1
	purchase of new kindle books is smart and simple.	1
	there are a couple of issues with the kindle that i find disturbing.	1
	the ability to highlight and navigate the indexes and tables of contents is difficult to master.	1
	the instructions are not clear in getting to use some of the features.	1
	other than that, the kindle is a fantastic product.	1
	i will recommend this product to my friends and family.      	1
	the best ereader currently available.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	the kindle dx for the aged.	1
	fantastic!!	1
	!.	1
	enjoy reading!.	1
	great for people who need larger print size.	1
	wonderful reading experience!.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	amazon kindle dx is a great product.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	amazing.	1
	perfect.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	amazing.	1
	wife loves it.	1
	great as far as it goes.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	kindle dx.love it, love it...what more can i say!	1
	just pre-ordered the new dan brown book and there it was this morning on my kindle.	1
	didn't even have to get dressed and go to the store to get it!	1
	gotta love the convenience.      	1
	electronics | kindle.save trees, keep a lot of material in one easily readable device, the kindle.	1
	i envision a possibility of a couple of years of college education saved in one place.	1
	easy to transport.	1
	never having to deal with previous students' highlights and notes (although sometimes, if the previous student was a good one, those notes were helpful).	1
	i don't know how colleges could make the extra money they do by reselling if a kindle, and the concept of a complete college education on the kindle, might cut down on a student's ability to sell last semester's books, thus raising money for the next round of required book purchases.	1
	but it would be great to have updated versions as one progressed in their chosen career.	1
	the ability to reference what the latest, greatest new theories are, without having to do new research would be valuable.	1
	problem with that is: what if you wanted to find the old information?	1
	what if you disagreed with the updated electronic version on your kindle and wanted to reference what was originally taught?	1
	or what if you wanted to compare previous beliefs to current beliefs?	1
	you could not because the updates would have already been done, without your knowledge and permission.	1
	with more customer feedback regarding what they want on an electronic reader such as the kindle, i am confident those options could be incorporated.	1
	for now, the options of being able to highlight and add notes and store massive information and easily carry it with you is very appealing to me.	1
	the growth potential of the kindle is huge! 	1
	my kindle dx.love it.	1
	use it every day.	1
	better than taking multiple books on business trips, and can shop from my chair wherever i am.      	1
	kindle dx.great innovation.	1
	no longer do i have to fill my luggage up with bulky, and heavy books.	1
	can't wait to read my next book.      	1
	the wunderkindle.for anyone who loves to read and travels a lot - or has limited storage space and no library available - the kindle is fantastic.	1
	my husband and i are voracious readers and are moving onto our 36 ft. sailboat.	1
	obviously, space is sverely limited.	1
	we had both been concerned about how we would take enough books with us.	1
	i got the 2nd generation kindle and my husband got the new dx as he reads more periodicals than i do.	1
	to our amazement, his wall street journal subscription costs $20 a month less than the mailed copy and has been flawlessly delivered every am - even when we were sailing down east in maine in august.	1
	we consistently had 2-3 bars and frequently had 3-5 bars in rural coastal areas.	1
	on top of that, we had more than enough reading material to satisfy us both.	1
	so far, my only disappointment is that the harry potter books are not available!	1
	to sum it up - we love our kindles and recommend them to all our friends and family.      	1
	my kindle dx.i am extremely pleaasantly surprised.	1
	it feels good in my hands, it is very well organized and it delivers my new york times faithfully every a.m.i haven't even begun to learn all the other  things it can do, but this it does magnificently.      	1
	convenient, easy...but miss a few things.i admit i never thought i would like the kindle.	1
	i bought this for my hubby's b'day and have since read a few books on it.	1
	overall i was surprised how much i like it.	1
	it's comfortable to hold, convenient & the screen is fairly easy on the eyes.	1
	i would have liked a backlight option (although i realize that would up the power needs) since the screen gets a little dark at times.	1
	also, i do wish there were some color options.	1
	otherwise i really do like the fact that buying and access to books is so easy, and the kindle has encouraged us to read a few books we would otherwise probably not have bought.      	1
	good for reading but have some software(?)	1
	bugs.the kindle dx provides me the best reading experience ever.	1
	however, i encountered the following problems, which i think may be software problems: 1) open a book -> wait for a while without touching any key -> normally, the kindle dx displays an image as screensaver.	1
	however, sometimes the screen becomes blank.	1
	in this case, i cannot tell whether the machine is shut down unwantedly, or it fails to show an image.	1
	2) sometimes, sliding the power switch and holding it for a few seconds (definitely less than the time needed to reboot the machine) reboots the machine, instead of shutting it down.	1
	3) i read a txt book in utf-8 encoding.	1
	i found that there were 3-4 places where text (about several hundred words) was missing.	1
	i promise that those were very common characters (ascii english letters, digits, punctuations), and they did appear in the txt file when i opened it in microsoft notepad / gvim / ... anything else.	1
	despite of all these, i think the kindle dx is very good.	1
	the e-ink screen is comfortable for my eyes; the dictionary is very convenient.	1
	i wish somebody in amazon could let me know how to fix these issues.	1
	that would make the kindle dx perfect.	1
	my kindle dx.this is absolutely wonderful and better than i could have ever imagined.	1
	it's so simple to use and it is so lightweight.	1
	i love the fact that i don't have to hold it while i read - i can just set it on my lap or a pillow and i only have to push the button to turn the page.	1
	this is fantastic and my husband loves it too.	1
	he likes the fact that he can get newpapers downloaded to it.	1
	this was absolutely one of our best electronic purchases ever!      	1
	my new best friend..my kindle is my favorite and best friend.	1
	during the past summer, i ordered and read several samples of books and then ordered the books as well.	1
	it is so simple and convenient, i think i read 12 books on kindle this summer.	1
	since i lead book discussion groups, underlining is essential to me and it was easy to do.      	1
	had my doubts but happy now.	1
	wonderful.i recently received my kindle dx as a graduation gift, and continue to be surprised at the convenience of this product.	1
	the size and weight are both easily manageable, especially when compared to that of a few books, which i would generally be carrying while traveling.	1
	i do wish it came with a backlight option, as it can be difficult to read in low light.	1
	overall it is very impressive.        	1
	kindle dx.i am in love with this device.	1
	i love to read.	1
	the problem is that i have to carry heavy books everywhere.	1
	now i don't have this problem anymore.	1
	i was also able to buy some medical references and carry my kindle with me avoiding the bulky books.my husband gave me the kindle dx for my birthday.	1
	it has been one of the best presents that i have received.	1
	thanks       	1
	enjoyment.	1
	excellent for reading while in bed..have had this kindl for just over one month.	1
	haven't really had it long enough time for a meaningful review.	1
	so far have found it to be a wonderful assist for people who like, or must, read in bed.	1
	if i could find the answer in the users guide, it would please me to be able to lock the horizontal or vertical aspects in place.      	1
	my kindle.i have had mine for about a month.	1
	i love to read.	1
	the first two weeks i didn't watch tv or do any of my crafts all i did was read.	1
	i believe i have 20 or so books now and with the exception of a few that i can't seem to get interested in i have read them all and enjoy them.	1
	i do recommend if you want to purchase and download to your kindle do it direct from the kindle not from the computer to the kindle it is much slower.	1
	i love my kindle.      	1
	you may want to consider-.i have had the dx for a bit over a month.	1
	today is the first day i do not have it with me.	1
	forgot it at home!	1
	i have to say that it is an amazing piece of technology.	1
	i like the ability to download reading materials almost instantaneously.	1
	i like getting the newspapers daily, although i am still trying to find one i want to keep.	1
	i did not have a kindle previously.	1
	my main problem with the kindle is organization.	1
	as i said, 30 days and i already have 3-4 pages of titles to scroll through to find what i am looking for.	1
	it does leave most recently read items at the top of the list, but i would like a folder system that would organize all subject onto one page.	1
	then open 'newspapers' or whatever names i select, and then find the item.	1
	as it is, every time i open the kindle it is like i have just picked up 20 books, periodicals, or newspapers and i have to sort through them to find what i want to read.	1
	does that make sense?	1
	it is distracting.	1
	i would also add that i do miss paper books.	1
	i have yet to find out how the airlines treat an electronic book.	1
	i may have to take a paperback along for the first and last 20 minutes.	1
	in closing, it is novel, a bit amazing, i like the dictionary, but for me, it just doesn't offer the same experience as a book in hand.	1
	i will keep using it, but will also read the real thing at every opportunity.      	1
	renewed desire to read.i seldom read, however after purchasing the kindle dx 9.7' latest generation for my wife i downloaded a book and read it cover to cover before my wife ever got a chance to use it.	1
	i've even decided to purchase another just so both of us can read at the same time.	1
	pros, screen not back lit makes it easy on the eyes.	1
	type size is adjustable for baby boomers in the transition between single vision and bifocal eye wear.	1
	light and portable allows for taking reading material anywhere, train, plane, waiting rooms.	1
	audio option great for bi-sensory input.	1
	hugh selection of reading material and affordable prices.	1
	grownup children can't raid our collection of books, never to be returned.	1
	cons, initial cost, but savings on purchases easily outweigh that issue.	1
	warranty could be improved.	1
	all in all a pleasurable high tech way to enjoy the low tech activity of reading.       	1
	kindle dx review.kindle dx is a great way to read a book.	1
	i love the large print, ease of carrying and holding.	1
	reads great in bright sun.	1
	i also appreciate the ease of reviewing books and reading what others have to say at the kindle store, before making my purchase.	1
	truly a breakthrough in reading.	1
	it will be interesting to watch its future as authors and publishers rethink the book distribution cycle.	1
	amazon is redifing the cost of a book.	1
	why pay more than $9.99 for any book?      	1
	kindle dx.love it!	1
	i like the larger format, the easy to read text...and how convenient it is to have definitions available on the same page as i read!	1
	the good part:  i can have a whole library in this thin, light-weight ebook, including reference books, novels, cookbooks, magazines, and newspapers.	1
	i can read for several hours on a single charge, and it automatically 'keeps my place' when i interupt my reading.	1
	it's very convenient to travel with, too.	1
	i love my kindle dx!      	1
	new dx user.bought the dx for my husband to take on the road when he travels and it hasn't left the house yet!!	1
	new to the kindle family, first purchase.	1
	chose the dx due to it's screen size...love it...since i haven't owned a kindle before the lack of next page button on the left side is not an issue for us.       	1
	the future is now.although pricey, the kindle dx exceeds anything similar on the current market.	1
	the light weight, easy to read electronic book allows you to not only carry dozens of full text books, but also, with low price subscriptions, obtain immediate news updates, magazines and blogs.carry the kindle dx eliminates 'dull moments' or 'down time' found throughout the day of daily activities.	1
	and for travel, it is perfect for planes, trains and automobiles (if you are not driving).      	1
	kindle dx.	1
	i love the kindle dx!	1
	i took it on vacation and read in the plane and near the pool.	1
	i'm too stubborn for bifocals so i really enjoy the larger print.	1
	i love the built-in dictionary.	1
	the ease of reading multiple books and articles with built in memory of where you left off reading is pretty handy.	1
	amazon has a good selection of books to select for the kindle.	1
	the optional male/female audible feature is also nice.        	1
	can't stop reading!.love the kindle dx.	1
	it makes reading so fast and easy, i think i will go broke buying books for it!	1
	the characters are crisp but not too much contrast and i love the size of the screen.	1
	the only downside for me is the lack of a page turning button on the left side of the screen, but the positives far outweigh this little flaw.	1
	i will just have to learn to drink my coffee left handed or put the cup down to turn a page.	1
	my husband has the first kindle and he loves his, too.	1
	we kept them on the same account so we can read books on either one.	1
	that is a nice feature!	1
	thanks, amazon!	1
	!      	1
	kindle dx: ok.the device is quite good.	1
	i have not used an ereader before and find reading this screen surprising pleasant.	1
	not paper-white, more a shade of grey, but you get used to that.	1
	clicking next page perhaps a little stiff.	1
	very strange that you cannot organize your downloaded library into folders.	1
	resizing font is excellent.	1
	cannot resize pdf displays of course.	1
	i use this mostly out of the us.	1
	i do not use the 'whispernet' feature due to non-us billing which i will not 'fix' just for this service.	1
	non-whispernet users are second class citizens.	1
	mobi or azw books of recent publication date not easily found except through amazon.	1
	even free kindle books via amazon not available for download unless billing information is us-based.	1
	pathetic.	1
	conclusion: a nice reading device, too expensive, pity about the amazon strangle-hold, but you should expect that when a bookseller sells a book reading device.	1
	will sell when something better, open, and global comes along.	1
	in the meantime my kindle is a repository for the oldies but goodies.      	1
	love it!!	1
	!.absolutely love my kindle.	1
	very easy on the eyes.	1
	battery only lasts me about 3 days but then again i read all day and night, so it's understandable.	1
	bigger screen is great.	1
	i would definitely recommend it to anyone.      	1
	amazing.love my kindle dx, it is even better that i imagined.	1
	the only problem with it is that i dont get to use it as much as i would like because my wife is always stealing it and reading her romance novels on it.	1
	at least i wont have a problem figuring out what to get her for christmas.      	1
	hardcover lover converts to kindle dx !.i originally pre-ordered the kindle dx for my husband who is a voracious popular fiction reader.	1
	he always likes to get the newest releases and often runs through 2 to 5 books he has purchased at sam's club, etc.	1
	for $15 to $25 in hardback (which he prefers) when at the beach on weekends.	1
	he dismissed the kindle dx before seeing it because 'he likes the feel of a book in his hands'.	1
	so i began to acquire several books and magazines i am interested in, and began to enjoy the kindle dx experience.	1
	over the long weekend of the 4th, he once again found himself without a new read and with no local bookstore available.	1
	i downloaded a new one for $9.99 and encouraged him try it out.	1
	he was instantly hooked!	1
	i had also purchased the leather cover so he might like it better.	1
	it really wasn't necessary, although i like the protection it provides.	1
	as soon as the color one comes out, i'll be getting one and handing this one off to him.	1
	hope that will be soon so we aren't fighting over this one!	1
	i also bought a 'sleeve' so it worked great on the beach without sand and water worries!	1
	we love our kindle-dx !      	1
	everything i expected it to be!.i an early adopter of the new kindle dx.	1
	this is new territory for me as i usually let a product be on the market for awhile before stepping in, but it was my 50th  birthday,i wanted to rediscover my passion for reading and decided to go for the larger format of the kindle dx.	1
	the kindle dx is performing exactly as expected.	1
	the screen is crystal clear and i have found the ability to modify the fonts very convenient as i like the larger fonts at night when my eyes are tired, but the smaller fonts other times.	1
	the ability to order books is as easy as amazon says it is.	1
	a couple of clicks and 60 seconds later the book is ready to read.	1
	personally, i peruse books using my computer on the website easier and faster, as i like to navigate more as i look for titles.	1
	the devices ability to rotate was more useful than i realized it would be.	1
	in particular, i find myself reading upside down to put the next page key on the left-side when i'm snuggled with my wife watching television.	1
	also, as a do a lot of reading and research while i travel, the ability to download pdf documents a real plus and the elimination of a few pounds of material is good news for my shoulders.	1
	the battery life is excellent and with the wireless turned off, i easily get more than a week of usage (i've haven't pushed the battery life beyond 10 days yet with the wireless off).	1
	things to note are that not all newspapers / magazines are created equal.	1
	it is worth your time to read the reviews and try them them before you buy.	1
	as publishers tailor their content for this medium, the quality should go up.	1
	the 'blink' when you go from one page to the next took me about an hour to get used to.	1
	now, i don't even notice it.	1
	finally, this is a device designed for 'readers.'	1
	if you are looking for quality pictures or high-end graphics the kindle dx is not for you!	1
	overall, highly recommended!      	1
	kindle dx exceeds expectations!.	1
	what i would like next.i have owned and used my kindle dx for a couple of weeks and find it is everything promised.	1
	the ability to change orientation at will makes it very easy to use under all reading situations.	1
	the consumption of power is very light, especially when not using the wireless.	1
	as a user of the iphone i find the synching of the two to be a terrific bonus as i find myself reading when i am waiting at restaurants, repair shops etc.	1
	without the need to carry my 'big' reader with me.	1
	since i use the iphone, i did find initially i was always trying to 'touch' the screen instead of using the multi-function control.	1
	although i have overcome this, i still would like to see this added to the functionality of the kindle.	1
	the larger screen for me makes it feel and look exactly like the hard covers i previously read.	1
	the ability to order up virtually what ever i want to read is an outstanding feature of all the kindle's.	1
	if you want the above conveniences, get one!       	1
	better than i thought.this is my first kindle.	1
	my husband bought it for me.	1
	i love it!	1
	it's bigger than i thought it would be, but i like it.	1
	some have said its too heavy to read in bed, but i've found that's not true for me.	1
	it's much easier and more comfortable.	1
	my hands would get tired trying to keep the books open, and trying to balance the heavier hardcover books in one hand for page turns.	1
	the kindle is more relaxing.	1
	i find it about as heavy as a magazine.	1
	the display is beautiful, i've never seen a kindle before (other than pics online) and i have to say i've never seen anything like it!	1
	it looks like a page from a book in a white frame.	1
	it looks so real that the first book i started reading i tried to turn the page like a paper book lol... i did that a few times.	1
	i find the keyboard keys work good.	1
	i have to put the kindle down to type because it's easier for me to reach all the letters.	1
	but, i have very small hands.	1
	when i put it down i can type just fine.	1
	if you have a cellphone with a keyboard, and can type on it, you can type on the kindle without much problem.	1
	i get my books in less than 60 sec.	1
	i live in a basement apartment and our cellphones sometimes have trouble getting a good signal, so i thought the kindle would be the same way.	1
	i did check the map to see if we had coverage where i live, and we do.	1
	the kindle works better than our cell phones!	1
	i get full bars... i never thought i would, i thought i would have to go outside to order books and whatnot.	1
	i am also impressed with the web browser, it is slow compared to your high speed connection, but fast for a mobile device.	1
	i don't have the web on my cellphone, so its nice to have that access anywhere anytime and for free!	1
	i can't think of much that could make it better, there are a few things, folders to organized books n things, there is a back button, but i would like to have a forward button because sometimes the back button takes you back to where you don't want to go.	1
	and... although i know the technology isn't ready yet... color would put this way over the top.	1
	anyone who loves to read, would love to have this kindle.	1
	i would also recommend a case to put it in.	1
	i didn't want to spend a lot on the case so i made my own.	1
	i took apart an old binder, took the cover and back of it, cut it down, covered in fabric and added elastic to hold it in place.	1
	i made it to pass the time, started it the day i ordered the kindle and finished it the day it was delivered... kept my hands busy!      	1
	a dramatic improvement.i have owned all three kindles now and believe there has been a wonderful evolution from a interesting concept to a powerful tool with great potential to change reading across the world.	1
	the kindle 2 was a step up over the original kindle, but the dx is a transformational change that brings textbook and business use into the realm of possibility.	1
	the size of the dx, its much improved button placement and the ability to use pdf files moves the kindle from a reading toy to full fledged reading tool.	1
	the challenge now is for amazon to convince america's textbook publishers that they have a system that can protect publishing rights.	1
	when they do a whole new world will be open to our students.      	1
	nice but for the price....	1
	i love it.well i just bought an amazon kindle dx and i am so happy with it!	1
	it is everything i wanted and more.	1
	the pdf support is wonderful, and the huge screen is amazing.	1
	i must give my thanks to: http://amazon-kindle-dx-review.com/ their review really helped me in the buying process... thanks!      	1
	the kindle dx makes reading easy and more fun than ever.	1
	this is a holdup!.mykindel dx is more than i imagined.	1
	after having a stroke, my ability to hold books with two hands is limited.	1
	one hand operation has provided more control and much faster reading.	1
	reading in bed is again possible.it's great to have that green feeling with the knowledge of saving trees.      	1
	amazon should cut the price down.today is my 5th day with my kindle dx.	1
	i am a grad student who need to read lots pdf journal papers.	1
	i like the screen size of dx which really makes me comfortable to read by clean words.	1
	it does heavier while i hold it in one hand.	1
	though it weighs like iphone 3g but the big size keeps you hard to hold it for a long time reading.	1
	wireless download and the screensaver are two of the sweet features in dx.	1
	i do wish amazon could let user set up their own custom screensaver.	1
	and let us upload images and doc files via usb not the wireless conversion.	1
	and i have to say that i am really disappointed about the pdf reader.	1
	amazon provide the native pdf support in dx but w/o the most important annotation and zoom in/out features.	1
	now, look at the machine i got:  it can read the books only on itself, and plus a pdf reader which cannot do anything but rotate the screen(fine, you can do some searching keywords).	1
	how could you claim the kindle dx as an e-reader?	1
	it cannot even support the most common file type, pdf, with the basic features.	1
	then you sell students the kindle dx as the highest price at market, $489 + $50 with a cover?	1
	i do not think dx worth the price because it doesn't provide the complete features for academic users, i cannot annotate/zoom in/out the most files(pdf) i have.	1
	and there is no proper file organization in dx.	1
	in addition, the text books i brought are only for kindle.	1
	i cannot read w/o the machine.	1
	i do hope amazon would let us upgrade the pdf annotation and zoom features via firmware update.	1
	also the doc, images files syn with personal computers.      	1
	as of 1/06/10 still no plans for epub support!.well, i have been considering the kindle dx as a gift for my sister's birthday, as she checks out library books all the time and is a total bookworm lol!unfortunately, the kindle dx does not support epub to freely download ebooks from her local library.i literally just got off the phone with amazon to enquire about this, was transferred to a '2nd tier' kindle dx specialist who informed me that, as of this date (1/06/10) there are no plans whatsoever for epub support, nor to address this issue in a future firmware update!?	1
	!an ereader that costs $500+ that won't support common, free ebook checkouts from your local library?!?!?	1
	very disappointing, not to mention greedy on amazon's part to intentionally omit this simple service that other ereaders support.	1
	i guess since at this point there are a trillion folks already pre-ordering this thing without epub support, amazon isn't very concerned about this affecting sales.	1
	maybe they're right!	1
	anyway, i'll be getting my sister sony's new ereader that has a touchscreen for her birthday this year, or perhaps the linux skiff 11.5' ereader - or one of the other 16 ereaders annouced to be released soon, all of which will support the open epub format so she can download all the ebooks she wants from her local library for free.	1
	thanks anyway, amazon! 	1
	very nice, but amazon could improve a few things.the big kindle is a very pleasant reading device.	1
	i did not expect that i would like the dx so much better than my regular kindle 2. fonts can be boosted to a pleasant size that make reading better than any 'normal' book.	1
	the most important component of the dx is the large e-ink display.	1
	there is no screen protection so the text seems to appear directly at the surface, just like real paper.	1
	this is better readable and easier on the eye than an lcd screen.	1
	resolution is 150dpi, which is about half of a good printer.	1
	it is sharp enough, but pixels are visible.	1
	contrast could be better.	1
	this is not disturbing for text but it makes kindle simply a poor photo viewer.	1
	in a side-by-side comparison, the dx has a noticeably better contrast  than the regular kindle.	1
	it also easily beats the sony readers.	1
	overall the experience is good, somewhat similar to reading an old newspaper.	1
	i find the hardware design of the kindle very nice and pleasant.	1
	not as good as apple would have done it, but pretty close.	1
	my only complaint is cheap quality and hard click of the buttons.	1
	the clicking sound of the 'next page' button wakes up my wife when reading in bed... the orientation sensor is a little too sensitive, causing unintentional textflips when holding the kindle nearly flat.	1
	i read several academic papers in pdf on the kindle dx.	1
	in the portrait orientation, the dx shows one full letter-sized page on the screen.	1
	since the screen is smaller, text is scaled down to a small size (about 6pt).	1
	its readable, but barely.	1
	turning the kindle 90 degrees enlarges the font to the exact same size as the printed paper.	1
	this is very usable, but not the apex of user friendliness.	1
	there are no other ways to zoom or pan, which is a shame.	1
	the biggest room for improvement on the kindle is the software.	1
	its okonce you're reading a book: that just requires tapping 'next page' a few hundred times.	1
	but it hurts to be confronted with a the prehistoric user interface when doing anything else.	1
	where do i start?	1
	the biggest issue is that all books and papers show up as a single endless directory listing.	1
	there is no way (yet?)	1
	to group and organize items.	1
	the directory listing itself is very basic: just titles and author names.	1
	there is no cover artwork, nor anything else that gives the impression that this is a big stack of books.	1
	the huge screen offers ample opportunity to do this right and make it look pretty.	1
	amazon's cupetino-based kindle engineers could learn a lot from their apple colleagues across the street.	1
	the 3g wireless connection can be quite sluggish at times, especiallyif network coverage is borderline.	1
	even with good 3g  coverage the basic responsiveness of the e-ink display simply does not allow for quick browsing.	1
	shopping for books is much more convenient on an iphone or on a regular computer.	1
	given this, i do not expectthat the 'experimental' web browser is useful except in emergencies.	1
	finally, how would the new apple ipad stack up against my kindle dx?	1
	is is the kindle-killer as the press reports?	1
	here is a quick 'apples' to 'kindles' comparison: form: wider (ipad) vs taller (not much difference in size)design: really nice (ipad) vs quite nice (dx)interface: multitouch vs dozens of buttonsscreen: 1024x768 color lcd vs 1200 x 824 greyscale e-ink.weight: 730 gr vs 535 grbattery life: 10 hours vs many daysprice: $629 (ipad 3g) vs. $499 (dx)monthly cost: $29 vs $0 (books likely more expensive for ipad)software interface: smooth & fast vs dorky lines with slow refreshversatility: multi-purpose vs e-reading onlyreadability: e-ink likely better in sun and easier on the eye.	1
	overall, its a hard comparison to make.	1
	i think that kindle is the better e-reader, while the ipad is a better multi-pupose device.	1
	kindle dx is expensive for what it does and also expensivegiven the actual bill-of-materials of the hardware.	1
	amazon will likely drop the price in the competition with apple.	1
	but for now, i'm very happy with the kindle dx.        	1
	great content delivery system - weak physical product.	1
	exceeds expectations.	1
	great device, with some minor shortcomings.	1
	perfect compliment to the k2..	1
	what's a kindle?.i had never heard of a kindle when my wife bought one for my 72nd birthday.	1
	i love to read so she thought it would be perfect for me.	1
	when i heard the what she paid for it, i thought it must really be something out of this world.	1
	i did read all the instructions as best i could and started using it, more to satisfy the wife than myself, and before i knew it, i was going through books and really enjoying using the kindle dx.after some 11 or 12 purchases, plus quite a few of the free books and samples, the sucker simply locked down, right in the middle of down loading a new book.	1
	i suspected it had to do with a downloading problem but really don't know what it was.i could turn it on and off but none of the buttons would work.	1
	i sent an e mail to kindle and so far haven't heard from them.	1
	finally, i called the toll free number, apparently to somewhere in india, and visited with a lady who did speak some english but was unable to diagnose my problem and referred me to another very pleasant lady, possibly in afganistan, who suggested that i turn it on.	1
	after i convinced her that it was turned on, she suggested that i turn it off and hold the button in the off position for exactly 20 seconds, release the button and 'wait one minute, please' which i did.	1
	still nothing worked but she did say that she was sending me a new kindle and that i should return mine when the new one arrived.the point of all this rambling is that i had never heard of a kindle and had no interest in having one until i got one as a gift.	1
	i would never have paid that much for one for myself to begin with and the books that i ordered were more expensive than those i usually buy.	1
	the thing i did like and appreciate was the convenience of getting what i wanted when i wanted it.as for the kindle itself, i have no problem with the keyboard or where next page or last page or any of the buttons are located.	1
	for me, all of them are new and something for me to adapt to.	1
	it was easy to read, advancing or going back a page was quick enough and i had no problem with any of the downloads except that last one when it didn't seem to work at all and finally just locked down.for me personally, the price of the kindle dx is far too high.	1
	amazon could give away the kindle and still make money one the books purchased.	1
	i hope to continue to enjoy the new kindle when it gets here and will continue to order the books, even at the higher price, simply for the convenience of being able to finish a book at midnight and get another one without having to drive to the store, which is closed at that time.it seems to be a good product that probably needed more testing before it was released.i like it pretty well but would never have seriously considered it at the price of $589.00 plus the cost of the books at $9.99 that can be bought in the store for $5.00 to $7.00.	1
	the unit is too expensive and the books are too high but a birthday gift from the wife really should not be returned unless i'm prepared for an extended discussion of my character defects.      	1
	cost prohibitive.i was looking for something that i could use to read and store multiple work related pdf files.	1
	i have a macbook which works fine, but the macbook is limited to its short battery life and size.	1
	i had hoped the kindle dx would be the answer to my needs.	1
	sadly, this was not the case.	1
	i have many pdf files, and the lack of folders to organize files and books really is unbelievable.	1
	it seems like such a simple thing to implement.	1
	turning pages takes too long and there is an annoying refresh on the screen when it goes to the next page.	1
	i guess i am spoiled when i can scroll through pdf pages on my laptop in mere seconds and find what i am looking for... e-ink or the kindle processor just seems too slow.	1
	i do not see how students could really use this effectively for college courses, note taking is too cumbersome.	1
	what kindle needs is a touch screen like the iphone, where you can zoom, scroll and resize pages easily and quickly.	1
	if you are going to read the latest novel... kindle dx is great.	1
	if you want to use it for textbooks, think twice... i really don't think the kindle is quite there yet, maybe in a couple of years though.       	1
	kindle dx.	1
	i love my kindle dx and couldn't be happier.my husband purchased the kindle dx for me for an anniversary gift and had it delivered to my work completely by surprised.	1
	i had no clue what was in the box because they took such care and gift wrapped it beautifully.	1
	anyhow, to the nuts and bolts.	1
	i've had my kindle just about a month now and i cannot complain about anything.	1
	i'm a person who is constantly connected with laptops (2)and my beloved iphone.	1
	first i'm a rabid reader (10 steps beyond avid,k?)	1
	and i am a student.	1
	the information that i've downloaded thus far has been invaluable and i can't believe how useful this is.	1
	i don't have a particular obsession with pdf's, but emailed myself one just to try and voila!	1
	perfection.	1
	i'm not such a technical guru that i want a book reader to do everything my computer can do so i'm not sensitive to those afflicted naysayers.	1
	i do apologize for that.	1
	currently, i am using my kindle dx in my a&p; lab for reference and despite it being in black and white, my lab group loves it too.	1
	i take it everywhere and i guard it with my life, because all plastic is fragile and i don't want to ever experience a break.	1
	i would reccommend it to anyone who can afford the extravagance.        	1
	kindle dx - i am in love!	1
	!.	1
	outstanding product.the kindle dx is everything i hoped for and more.	1
	first and foremost, it is an enjoyable reading experience.	1
	it really is easier than a book.	1
	secondly, it gives me easy access to material.	1
	the book catalog is large and growing.	1
	the access to outstanding printed newspapers and magazines is very important to me, not living in a large metropolitan area.	1
	the fact that i have all of that in one place and always with me has increased my ability to fit reading all of this material into a busy schedule.	1
	not often do you get a chance to purchase a product that impacts you day to day as much as the kindle has me.      	1
	love the kindle!.this is my first kindle and i am hooked!	1
	i cannot imagine carrying around bulky books again, it is so easy to use and fits in my (large) purse.	1
	also, i have been downloading some free books to try it and love those too.      	1
	husband likes it.i bought the kindle for my husband to eliminate the stacks of books accumulating around the house.	1
	he has had nothing but good comments about the kindle, uses it everyday.	1
	kindle books are reasonably price, easy to use.	1
	great product so far.	1
	have to wait and see how it holds up with everyday use.        	1
	bigger is better.this is a better kindle, not as small as the original.this is easier to hold for older folks,like myself,with arthritis.	1
	the keyboard is also larger and i can read the text even when i forget my glasses!           	1
	great item--hard to hold.along with the bigger size, the dx assumes a bit more heft and the hand holding the device at a comfortable reading angle gets tired.	1
	need accessory that will support the dx at an adjustible angle in or out of a jacket.       	1
	kindle dx.	1
	kindle.i would have been great to see the kindle prior to purchase.	1
	no worries.	1
	it comes with easy to use directions.	1
	the product is great.	1
	the cons, not all subscriptions are inexpensive.	1
	some of the books are also high.	1
	hope that some price adjustments are coming in the future.      	1
	love my kindle 2, getting closer to loving the kindle dx.updated: 6/12/09 got a kindle dx because of the volume of graphics laden technical books i read along with a myriad of other non-fiction.	1
	i definitely can see those much better than on my kindle 2. it is bulkier and heavier than the kindle 2, as i expected and won't fit in my purse like the kindle 2 does.	1
	not sure if i want to contend with two devices though they do synchronize well to the last read spot if you go back to the home page before turning it off.	1
	the next few days will determine if i keep it...  readable graphics good,  auto-rotate is a bit touchy and now that i have figured out that auto-rotate works in all four directions i'm almost up to 5 stars.	1
	i thought that it was 'missing' the left side button.	1
	what was missing was my thinking.	1
	i can turn it upside down and viola!	1
	left side buttons...	1
	yeay!!	1
	!      	1
	kindle dx review.i love it!!	1
	i received it from my husband as a christmas gift (i guess the hinting worked.)	1
	and i knew i'd like it.	1
	but... i love it!!	1
	i enjoy it more then i thought i would.	1
	i don't know how much more good i can say about it besides that it's so cool, and convenient, and beyond my expectations.	1
	did i mention that i love it?	1
	!      	1
	perfect, but....everything is great, except: *it needs to be backlit.	1
	period.	1
	*the lag time is ridiculous.	1
	when i click next page, the screen shouldn't have to go blank, then light up, then black out before the next page's words show up.	1
	*the home menu doesn't have folders for books.	1
	they're all just thrown in there, no organization whatsoever.	1
	other than that stuff, i love it. 	1
	kindle dx review.	1
	kindle dx goes over the top!.	1
	i  love it.	1
	i love my kindle and i look forward to many years of use.	1
	kindle dx is the best.it's my 1st day using kindle dx , it's really very good , it's reading arabic books , but i have aproblem by conecting to internet whithout wireless , if any one can help in how to conect to internet without u.s wireless network ?	1
	thanks ahmad      	1
	love my kindle - suggestion.i love my kindle.	1
	i have had it since july and it has transformed my reading habits tremendously.	1
	i love it so much that i bought my wife one for her birthday - last week!	1
	she loves her too so we are not even going to attempt to send it back to amazon to get the $40.00 difference.	1
	i am sure there are many folks like us who purchased a new kindle in the last 30 days so my suggestion to amazon is send those that have a $20.00 gift certificate.	1
	with that they can purchase two books and you will have a lot of happy customers.       	1
	a pleasure.	1
	unbelievable.it is everything it says it is and more.	1
	i bought it for my wife and she loves it.	1
	i highly recommend this product.	1
	if you purchase this make sure to buy a case with it.      	1
	'i am impressed with kindle dx'.	1
	fabulous dx.after one month i am just loving my dx.	1
	as a born & raised new yorker, the convenience & luxury of having the sunday nytimes bright & early each sunday morning as i travel throughout the us is better than i could have expected in my lifetime.	1
	no more frantic driving around small town usa searching each sunday...and it's only 75cents!	1
	and also easy access to lots of great books.       	1
	one month and dead.i've never written a review in amazon after years of buying books, gifts, toys...but i'm so upset about the kindle that i had to write a review with the hope that it will stop someone else from buying one.	1
	i am an avid reader who travels and i buy about 2-3 books per trip.	1
	my husband gave me a kindle for xmas and although i was hesitant, i quickly loved it.	1
	i took 3 trips and used my kindle on each trip.	1
	i carry it inside my briefcase along with cell phone, ipod, and mac.	1
	on my last trip, i took it out and the screen had some weird lines running through it.	1
	i couldn't turn it on or off.	1
	just 30 days in and a portable device is broken without a cause.	1
	something so delicate should not be sold as a portable device and huge warnings for 'buyer beware' should be put on stickers all over it that you shouldn't use it if you travel--which basically makes it useless to those that most would need it.	1
	do not buy.      	1
	change of heart.i wrote the scathing review below after a couple of weeks with the dx, and i did come very close to returning it.	1
	now i'm really very fond of it.	1
	the key to the change, and to the decision to buy a dx, is to recognize what it is and is not.	1
	dx is not a big version of kindle 2.  you cannot hold it as you would a paperback, softcover or kindle 2.  it is really a laptop device, and is akin to a big hardcover or textbook.	1
	to enjoy it you will need to read it at a desk or (my preferred method) resting it on a pillow on your lap.	1
	in these positions, the placement of the buttons is not an issue, and you can type comfortably with you index fingers.	1
	if you can accept the reduction in reading flexibility, then the large screen and pdf display are great to have; especially if you need to read a lot of documents for work.	1
	if you would prefer to just carry novels on the go, buy a kindle 2.	1
	'i got a kindle 2 for christmas that i loved.	1
	intrigued by the prospect of a bigger screen and pdf support, i returned it and purchased the dx.	1
	big mistake.	1
	this design is hopelessly flawed.	1
	the buttons are in the wrong place to be comfortable: i had to hold the thing upside down.	1
	the keyboard is just about useless:  you can't reach all the keys with your thumbs, and must hold the kindle in one hand and 'peck' on the keyboard with the other.	1
	the really big drawback, however, is the weight.	1
	this thing weighs a ton.	1
	don't be fooled by the slick pictures of people holding it in one hand, that hurts.	1
	even holding it in two hands is uncomfortable.	1
	i'm sending it back and getting a nice kindle 2.'	1
	i can read it!.i'm presbyopic, as are a fair number of other people, and this is the first ereader that i can read and afford at the same time.	1
	i loved my sony prs-500, but it just didn't cut it with the technical pdf's and papers i so desperately wanted to use it with.	1
	most 8.5x11 pdfs were absolutely, undeniably unreadable, even with the right reading glasses ;-) but i can read the kindle dx for about 98% of what i've thrown onto it, and i can even read the native formatted books without my aforementioned glasses when i select the large font!	1
	my only real gripes are that colors on a page can make things harder to read, and the dx doesn't like displaying everything in the pdfs from google books.	1
	but then, it is a monochrome display, so i can't complain too loudly about the lack of vivid colors, and with a little pdf massaging, the books from google work just fine.	1
	so, i give this an unqualified 5 stars.	1
	sure, you can't read it in the dark without a light, or annotate things on it, or easily take notes with it, or use it as a tablet, or watch streaming video on it, or get all interactive with it, but what's important to me is that i can put lots of papers and books into it that i can read.	1
	it's the first, and much more capable products will follow very quickly.	1
	but like with henry ford at the turn of the century - things have changed, and for me, this is the product that changed it.	1
	and if you're one of those people who feel a need to give it one star because it broke when you dropped it and stepped on it, or because it's larger and heavier than a magazine, you really should look into some other hobbies.      	1
	very happy.	1
	aww - but no wifi in europe...sucks.	1
	'newspaper' kindle dx.i really love this product.	1
	it is truly incredible.	1
	the only reason that i have rated it a four star, rather than a five, is because it is not back-lit.	1
	it requires a reading lamp to read at night.	1
	otherwise, it has great features.	1
	i especially love the easily accessed dictionary.        	1
	kindle dx.i just received my kindle dx.	1
	i had not had one before the only thing i can say about it.	1
	i wish it had a built in light.	1
	i like to read while my husband is driving or when we are on a bus, plane or whatever.	1
	i do not like to have to carry the light to put on it.	1
	i would like it built in.	1
	one less thing i have to carry the easier the better.	1
	so i gave it 4 stars i want a light built in the kindle dx.	1
	is that asking to much?      	1
	the new kindle dx.i bought the new kindle for my husband for father's day from all of us and he hasn't put it down.	1
	he travels a lot for business and is always buying the latest hardcover books.	1
	this is perfect because it doesn't take up much space in his briefcase or luggage and he can download a new book when he finishes what he's reading.	1
	he has also been able to have documents he needs to see from work sent to his kindle while on travel and that has been a great convenience.	1
	the larger screen on this newer version is more the size of a book page, so it seems to be a big improvement over the old model.	1
	the kindle will pay for itself soon because the book downloads are $9.99 vs. over $20 each for the hardcover editions.	1
	it's easy to use and it's one of the best gifts we've ever given him.      	1
	avid reader of novels loves the new kindle dx.i purchased the kindle dx for my wife who reads 2 to 5 novels a month.	1
	she did not think she would like it and thought she would always prefer to read from the printed page.	1
	she is totally won over.	1
	it is pleasant to use, very easy.	1
	the ability to download a book is a big plus for her.	1
	best gift i have given her.	1
	hightly recommend for the heavy reader.      	1
	user-friendly, practical solution for travel.we had the kindle dx up and running within minutes of opening the box.	1
	instructions are clear, whispernet available in all remote locations so far and downloads are ridiculously easy.	1
	we've loaded several books and the daily nyt.	1
	screen is easy to read - even outdoors and the online dictionary is handy.two small criticisms: 1.it arrives in a box that is useless for portability and has no folder or way to protect it until you purchase a cover.	1
	2.it's not easy (or free) to clip articles and send them to email.	1
	price is steep but it's a computer, after all!      	1
	dx makes reading fun again!.greatest thing since sliced bread.	1
	now i can read with a cat in my lap.	1
	the kindle dx is simple to use, and i love the way it automatically switches from portrait to landscape whenever i turn it on it's side.	1
	comfortable reading anywhere in any position.	1
	everyone should have one.      	1
	great product, beware of content restrictions.amazon really advanced the e-book reader market the same way that google advanced web search, or apple advanced smart phones.	1
	the problem is that they have neglected the consumer who they are targeting these devices to.	1
	there are very restrictive and secrete restrictions on your books; many people have thought that you could download a purchased book unlimited number of times only to find out that they are suddenly left unable to read a purchased book unless they buy it again.	1
	there are also restrictions on how many devices that you may have a book on at any one time, and while this is not necessarily a bad thing, it can be different for every book and is not clearly stated when purchasing how many devices it may be downloaded to.	1
	the worst and most egregious problem has come lately when kindle readers found that a purchased book was remotely deleted from their devices.	1
	this is the most invasive rape of consumer rights and draconian digital rights management to date.	1
	consumers with no warning, had a product that they had purchased stolen from them by the merchant.	1
	amazon needs to assert itself on the side of consumers, and until it gets it's act together and starts fighting for us and not against us, no one should purchase or recommend this product.	1
	the only way our disgust can be heard is to vote with our dollars, so please wait until the kindle is an open platform that is neutered of its remote-delete capabilities and has clear and prominent information about number of downloads / devices, or another competitor fills this need.	1
	amazon - apple has realized that drm does not work, and has begun selling uncrippled music.	1
	the riaa has also publicly stated that drm does not work.	1
	champion your users, and our rights and you will be rewarded.       	1
	works great.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	it is a big deal.	1
	i don't know how i lived without it!.i love my kindle dx!	1
	it is everything they advertised.	1
	i love being able to purchase books in a series as i finish one.	1
	i like reading several books at once, and this is perfect for that.	1
	it was great on vacation!	1
	this has been well worth the money because i would always buy new hardback as they came out.	1
	there is also an amazing selection of free books or books for very little money.	1
	the only downside is that my sisters are upset with me, because they always used to get my used books :-). 	1
	kindle dx.i just love my kindle dx.	1
	it is light and i can carry it where ever i go.	1
	it is not cumbersome.	1
	i also like how i can prop it in bed and flip the text so i can read it on my side or on my back.	1
	other features is the sampling of the book before i purchase, purchasing it from the kindle itself, options to purchase magazines, to blog, etc.	1
	i can also review how to use the different features the kindle has such as book marking, highlighting, archiving books i have already read.	1
	when the kindle is off the graphics are incredible.	1
	i never get tired of viewing the pictures and what will appear next.       	1
	everything i thought it would be!.i have now had my first ebook reader the kindle dx for a month and i am enjoying it immensly.	1
	i agree with all the positive reviewers on the site pertaining to features and benefits.	1
	i like the cover that you can buy for it from amazon.	1
	both front and back are magnitized to hold it tight against the kindle when closed.	1
	it also has a good locking system to prevent the kindle from falling out.	1
	my only complaints are its hefty price and the lack of being able to organize into folders the various books and subscriptions that you purchase.	1
	i got help on the price because i convinced the kids to make my fathers day and birthday presents a contribution toward the kindle purchase and i made up the rest.	1
	how great would it be to be able to go to the home page and see folders for fiction, non-fiction, magazines, newspapers, and the subfolders for mystery, biography etc.	1
	i think i have purchased 12 books so far and have several more pending either in sample or later.	1
	why make us go through a long list of all types to find the book or magazine or newspaper we wish to access?	1
	it would also be nice to be able to make notations about the books in a folder next to the name like an authors first or fifth in a series, a specific character book, likes or dislikes, etc.	1
	i hope a simple program modification could bring this to reality.	1
	other than that i am very happy i and the kids bought my kindle dx.      	1
	general comment.after owning the first version of kindle, and having purchased the dx version of kindle, i have two comments to make.first, this is a great product and i'm glad to own both the first version and the dx version.second, i have two complaints about the dx version.	1
	first, it is rather heavy and uncomfortable when you are holding it in one hand.	1
	second, the 'back' button is in the wrong place.	1
	since i hold the dx version near the bottom with my right hand;  every once in a while i hit the back button by mistake, and then  i have to go browsing thru the various settings before i can find where i was reading.	1
	this is rather annoying.	1
	i realize that this is not a situation that is going to be resolved for my benefit, but i thought i would mention it, anyway.	1
	bob lamagdelaine p.s.	1
	i still think this is a great product.      	1
	screen size.one thing i have yet to see in any reviews is this: how large, diagonally, is a typical paperback page?	1
	knowing how a k2 or dx measures up against your standard reading media (trade paperback, hardback, or newspaper) might help a lot of people decide.	1
	if the k2 is equal or larger than a standard paperback page it would be ideal for people who use that media most often.	1
	likewise the dx for people who have a ton of textbooks to slug around or read a lot of periodicals or newspapers.      	1
	i love it.	1
	please wait for the next version.	1
	ejs.i purchased two kindle dx, one for myself and one for my 15 year old.	1
	what a remarkable device!	1
	i travel a great deal for my business and am an avid reader.	1
	my 15 year old is a passionate reader.	1
	the kindle is a perfect tool for a business traveler.	1
	i do not have to schlep newspapers or books along on the many trains, planes and automoblies i find myself in.	1
	kindle is remarkably easy to use.	1
	i am dismayed at some of the negative reviews.	1
	they seem to take this product then develop some perfect hypothetical product to compare it to.	1
	that is an unfair analysis.	1
	as a newer technology and now as wireless i find this a wonderful thing.	1
	it is exciting to think where this will be in two more years.my only suggestion is to have page numbers for easy reference and citation.	1
	the extended warranty, which i did not purchase, is over priced.	1
	cheers to amazon!      	1
	device great; book selection limited.the device is easy to read, downloads books quickly and otherwise functions well.	1
	i was very disappointed to discover the selection of available books is limited and excludes most new publications.	1
	perhaps some (or even many)of them will be available in the future, but there is no indication of how long that might be (months?	1
	years?)	1
	or if they will ever become available.	1
	check availability of your favorite authors before investing!       	1
	kindle is defective by design.the kindle is the best demonstration of how drm passes power from the consumer to the retailer of intellectual property.	1
	'defective by design' refers to a device intentionally manufactured to not work properly, in order to cause consumers to spend more money.	1
	this is, in a nutshell, the kindle.	1
	amazon has already done things to owners of kindles that they wouldn't dare to do with customers of physical books.	1
	most recently, they deleted copies of 1984 and animal farm off customers kindles after the publisher 'changed its mind' about publishing the ebooks.	1
	would you let amazon come into your home and retrieve books you had bought if they changed their minds about selling them to you?	1
	of course not!	1
	but with the kindle, you don't 'buy' anything, you are only licensing the right to read the book -- and amazon can retract that license at any time.	1
	as another example, they've also crippled the read aloud feature, on already-purchased books, without notice.	1
	the technology behind the kindle is wonderful.	1
	but until amazon realizes that consumers deserve the same rights whether they buy a physical book or an electronic book, i'll stick to the ones i can hold in my hand.      	1
	kindle dx reader.this is an amazing device.	1
	download books in 60 seconds.	1
	unbelievable!!	1
	i read 3-4 books a week and was running out of room to store them.	1
	now they're all contained in one place about the size of a magazine.	1
	the text is very clear and the controls are simple.	1
	about the only thing the kindle doesn't do is actually read the book for you.	1
	however, it will read the book to you.	1
	how great is that?	1
	i'm so happy i got the kindle.	1
	i recommend it to anyone who loves to read.           	1
	global?	1
	.....'slow'bal.i decided to purchase the global kindle dx when service became available in thailand.	1
	so, i got my kindle dx in the mail, and immediately ordered several books.	1
	now i fully expected that 60 second downloads was just a bit to high of an expectation for thailand (the wireless infrastructure here is fairly sluggish compared to the u.s.) but i did expect considerably more (faster) than i'm getting.	1
	of the several books i ordered only one downloaded within the hour, the others took several hours, and the last, well, i'm still waiting.	1
	if you are considering the kindle dx, and you live in thailand or ,probably, a number of other countries, be prepared for very lengthy download times.	1
	amazon really should be more forthcoming and accurate concerning the speed and accessibility of digital content overseas, especially since it is marketed as a 'global' device.	1
	also, chargers for international content delivery pricing was a huge surprise !!!!!	1
	anyone wishing to download content overseas must add an additional $1.99 per purchased book, and $0.99 per megabyte for personal documents.	1
	of course, one can still transfer data directly from a pc, but the mac version is only a pipe dream, just like all 'coming soon' amazon products... define 'soon'  .. come on amazon!	1
	these 'extra' charges aren't really disclosed to the international buyer until after the purchase and delivery.	1
	the kindle dx is a solid product and not a lemon, but amazon's deceptive business practices remind me of a used car lot.	1
	international buyers beware, there are costly details you should know up front, and you won't read about them in the item description.      	1
	too fragile.this kindle is an awesome instrument and very enjojable to use, the one factor that some one needs to consider is how fragile this instrument turely is.	1
	we just returned from cruise in europe.	1
	after the first day my wife's kindale suffered some minor trauma that totatlly destroyed the function for the screen.	1
	she was able to use th audio, but no sceen function.	1
	she was told this was outside normal use and it would cost $280 to repair it.	1
	i would suggest that the smaller version wouod be more appropriate for that want to us it during travel because the larger vesion injury      	1
	great product - love it but follow up on questions is lousy lousy lousy.i bought this about 2 months ago because i travel a lot overseas - for long periods of time.	1
	i wanted to reduce the number of books i had to carry and also wanted to put as many of my professional references on it as i could.	1
	for that purpose it is really great and i would recommend it to anyone - obviously pricey but worth it in my case.	1
	the reason i gave it 3 stars is because the follow up on questions (customer service) is nonexistent.	1
	i submitted a question about a down load issue and got nothing (nada) back.	1
	amazon has great customer service in general and i can't understand why they would not provide the same to their own 'baby'.      	1
	it's a good read!.	1
	kindle dx.the kindle dx is the best thing that i have had in a long time.	1
	my husband bought it for my birthday.	1
	it is one of the best gifts ever!      	1
	i love saving the paper and trees..we love our new kindle.	1
	it works like a charm.	1
	the newspaper shows up everyday, wirelessly.	1
	the print is easier to read than the newspaper.	1
	i don't have to take out the 20 lbs of unwanted ads every sunday to the recycle bin!       	1
	kindle dx.the kindle dx is far better than i ever expected.my wife has added books and i rarely get to use it.looks like i may have to buy another!!	1
	!i have downloaded personal pdf files for quick reference.	1
	amazon ,kindle store, has a huge selection of books, magazines etc.	1
	which are so easy to download.this is a great product.      	1
	the dx is great!.the kindle dx is a great way to read your favorite books.	1
	the larger format makes it feel like you are reading the hardback editions.	1
	i like the full pdf compatibility because i take all my tech manuals and put them on the kindle dx.	1
	with this capability i convert 40 pounds of books into the size of the kindle dx which makes for a much lighter load.	1
	the search feature for the pdf's makes finding data easy and the notes let me make comments concerning detailed steps in the document.	1
	i just haven't figured out how to print the notes yet.	1
	if i can i will figure it out but if not then maybe in the future we will have a way.      	1
	kindledx.i've had the dx for a couple of weeks.	1
	i'm happy with it.	1
	the size allows a decent font size for a full book page which is a plus for aging eyes.	1
	the keyboard is a little spread out but i don't use it very much so it is not a big deal -- works when i need it.... battery life is good... probably 5 days with my normal use... turning off the wireless when i don't need it.	1
	the font on the pdf's i've loaded is small but when i turn the screen to landscape the increased font size is adequate.	1
	cons: it is a bit heavy for holding ... i find myself resting it on something after a bit.	1
	this is not a big issue for me.	1
	it's also a little large for feeling comfortable on public transportation... would make me feel a little self-conscious on the bus.	1
	i particularly don't like the lack of folders for organizing the books.	1
	i have two pages now and it is getting to be a pain to find what i want and then scroll the cursor to it.	1
	this could be fixed with a software upgrade and i hope it will be soon.... finally, an annoyance re the kindle one-click ordering.	1
	i use two different credit cards for ordering books.	1
	the amazon one-click ordering system for the kindle only uses the 'default' card.	1
	i want a dropdown that allows selection of the card to use *when i press the one-click' ...this is available for other orders why is it disabled for the kindle?       	1
	kindle dx.thought i would miss a 'real' book but it did not happen.	1
	this e-reader is terrific.	1
	no complaints from here!      	1
	1st kindle.this is my first kindle purchase and so far i really like the device.	1
	it appears that i have enough room for an entire library of books, i like the native pdf support, however missing zoom feature on the pdf's is a big negative (hopefully it will come with a firmware update???	1
	), the page turning is a little slow, but i have timed it out just right when reading the last sentence or two so that i can press the button ahead of time and the page updates for 'smooth' reading.	1
	the pdf, especially my local newspaper, can take quite some time to render.	1
	wi-fi would have been a nice touch so i could use my faster network at home to shop and wireless downloading of pdfs.	1
	backlighting or a light of some kind would be nice as in dim settings, the screen cannot be read (same problem as a book).	1
	headphone jack is at the top of the device which is an odd place.	1
	audio reading feature is lacking, very computerized voice sounding...like on pcs.	1
	i love the auto dictionary feature for those uncommon words.      	1
	awesome reader.	1
	i love my kindle dx.i bought a kindle 2 in september and liked it so much that i brought a dx in november.	1
	i use my dx at home and carry the k2 to work with me everyday.	1
	the kindles do just what i brought them for.	1
	to re-read my old favorites, without eye strain and allow me to get rid of my dtbs and save space.	1
	i am getting ready for my old age.	1
	the kindle does what it was designed to do, without any problems at all...make sure to get a  to go with your kindle.      	1
	i love my kindle dx.i received my kindle dx a few days ago and i love it.	1
	a couple of years ago i bought a sony reader, but the kindle dx is a much superior product.	1
	what i like best about the kindle is the wireless capability.	1
	i no longer have to be near my pc to download books as i did with the sony reader, plus the amazon kindle store has more books than the sony reader store.	1
	the kindle is not perfect, however, and i have detailed below the pros and cons of the kindle.	1
	overall, however, the kindle is a wonderful product and much superior to the sony reader.	1
	unfortunately, the unit does not come with earphones.	1
	come on, amazon, for $500.00 you can throw in some earphones.	1
	pros:  * the most obvious and primary advantage of the kindle dx is the wireless capability.	1
	as long as i am in an area with 3g coverage, i can shop the kindle store and download a book, without the need of a computer.	1
	while the sony is a nice product, one had to have access to their pc to purchase and download a book.	1
	also, the sony used a lot of memory and often froze up my computer when syncing with the reader.	1
	that is obviously not a problem with the kindle.	1
	this feature alone makes the kindle my number one choice for an e-reader.	1
	* the kindle dx is huge!	1
	it is much larger than i expected.	1
	this is both a plus and a slight disadvantage as well.	1
	the large screen makes reading much easier than on the sony reader, which is about the size of a mass-marker paperback book.	1
	the kindle dx's screen is at least the size of a hardback book.	1
	however, with size comes weight.	1
	the kindle dx is much heavier than i expected.	1
	i purchased the cover ($50) and am glad i did.	1
	i do not plan to drop the kindle, but as heavy as it is, i wanted to provide all the protection for it i could.	1
	the nicest thing about the size is it is easy on the eyes, especially for older eyes.	1
	* having browsed both the kindle store and the sony reader store, i can assure you the amazon kindle store has a much larger selection of books.	1
	this was another reason i switched from the sony to the kindle.	1
	often, there was a book i wanted, but sony did not have it available, but it was available for the kindle.	1
	* the kindle customer support was fantastic.	1
	the first day i had a lot of questions, and having customer support available 24/7 was a lifesaver.	1
	in addition, the customer support team was located in the united states and able to communicate effectively over the phone.	1
	* the kindle battery life is fantastic.	1
	i have not had to charge the battery for days now and it is still well charged.	1
	my sony machine had to be charged after a few hours of use, despite their claims to the contrary.	1
	who wants their reader to shut down right in the middle of a book because the battery is low?	1
	that will not happen with the kindle.	1
	cons:  * the biggest con is the price.	1
	the kindle dx lists at $489.00.	1
	with shipping, it will cost over $500.00.	1
	this is a huge expense.	1
	however, one can partially justify the price by the savings of the price of books for the kindle, which run under $10, as opposed to $15 to $30 at the bookstore.	1
	over time, it will pay for itself.	1
	* the use and location of the buttons is another slight disadvantage of the kindle.	1
	the buttons are not naturally intuitive and certainly not 'user-friendly.'	1
	the 5-way controller appears to be the 'menu' button the way the unit is labeled.	1
	this caused some initial confusion.	1
	the problem with the location of the buttons is they are located exactly where i hold the kindle and are easily pressed by accident.	1
	in addition, the 5-way control button sticks up and is also easily pressed, especially when the cover is closed.	1
	however, thanks to the excellent customer support at kindle, i was able to figure out the proper use of the buttons.	1
	* one other disadvantage of the kindle is the weight of the unit.	1
	the kindle dx is much larger and heavier than xpected.	1
	obviously, it is lighter than carrying around a bunch of books, but i did expect it to weigh less.	1
	one certainly does not want to drop and break a $500.00 electronic device.	1
	* one feature i wished the kindle contained is a light so the device could be used in the dark or at night without turning on an external light that might disturb others trying to sleep.	1
	the sony reader has a light that illuminates the text so the user can read it in the dark.	1
	that is a great feature, but not contained in the kindle.	1
	* one final feature i loved in the sony reader but missing in the kindle is the touch screen.	1
	the pages in the sony reader can be turned forward or backward by running the finger across the screen.	1
	the kindle requires the reader to press a next page or previous page button.	1
	this is not a major disadvantage with the kindle, but it would be a nice feature to have.	1
	overall, however, i must give the kindle a 4-star rating.	1
	it is a great unit, much superior to the sony reader or the nook, which is newly on the market.	1
	i love my kindle and look forward to using for years to come.	1
	while there are pros and cons with the kindle, the pros far outweigh the cons.	1
	i would recommend this to anyone who loves to read and wants to sever the tie with carrying around a bunch of paper books. 	1
	great product.	1
	hooked.	1
	love love love my kindle!!!	1
	!.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	advantage anywhere.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	it's wonderful.	1
	dx.shocked at how many typo's there are in the books i'm reading on the kindle, dx.	1
	wasn't expecting that--      	1
	needs better features for visually impaired or blind.the kindle dx has many benefits but it is far from perfect for people who are blind or have visual impairments.	1
	there are some features that are very good.	1
	(but they are not applicable for all reading on the kindle dx.	1
	)it has choices for font size for the books.	1
	(but it will not enlarge the menus.	1
	the largest font for the books is not large enough for all people.	1
	)it will read a book with what i think is the best voice i have heard yet.	1
	(but it will not read the list of the names of books that you have on the kindle.	1
	and it won't read the menus - which are not enlargeable either.	1
	)the e-ink is easy on the eyes.	1
	(but is does not have much contrast and no color.	1
	)the keyboard at the bottom is very small.	1
	- hard to see and hard to use without fingernails or a pencil!the buttons on the side do not respond quickly and sometimes they don't respond at all.	1
	i never know whether i should keep waiting or push the button again.it won't read the title and the font can't be enlarged so it is impossible for some people to independently pick which book they want to read.overall, i like the kindle dx ok for myself, although somethings about it are frustrating,but it is not good for many people i know who are visually impaired or blind.      	1
	the dx is awesome.the dx is a wonderful product that exceeded my expectations.	1
	the screen is fantastic and the 'readibility' is great.	1
	expensive but worth the money.      	1
	say no to drm.copied from defectivebydesign.com we believe in a way of life based on the free exchange of ideas, in which books have and will continue to play a central role.	1
	devices like amazon's are trying to determine how people will interact with books, but amazon's use of drm to control and monitor users and their books constitutes a clear threat to the free exchange of ideas.	1
	that is why we readers, authors, publishers, and librarians demand that amazon remove all drm, including any ability to control or access the user's library, from the kindle.	1
	amazon's assurances that it will refrain from the worst abuses of this power do not address the problem.	1
	amazon should not have this power in the first place.	1
	until they give it up they will be tempted to use it, or they could be forced to by governments or narrow private interests.	1
	whatever amazon's reasons for imposing this control may be, they are not as important as the public's freedom to use books without interference or supervision.      	1
	miss the sd slot.one of the biggest reasons that keeps me away from the kindle dx is the absence of an sd slot.	1
	i really need an e-reader for all the pdf's i carry around o n my laptop and i have a ton of these documents.	1
	however they will not fit into the kindle dx and hence carry my laptop around.	1
	ideally though i'd prefer to carry a lighter device !	1
	perhaps one of the newer windows 7 laptops from sony or dell might do the job.	1
	however if the dx or if they came with an ex that had an sd slot with the same features then i would buy it in a jiffy.	1
	i do need native pdf support for double byte docs and kindle 1 does not support that.	1
	in fact some of the fonts look wierd on k2.	1
	not having an explansion slot, loading the native pdf's is a pain, particularly since i have over 12 gb of them.      	1
	native pdf but font is so small that it can't be read easily - iphone does it.i purchased the dx expecting that i could read the pdf files at any font size and i paid extra for the dx because i had the kindle 2 but returned it because it couldn't read complex pdf documents.	1
	now i can't read them because the font is too small.	1
	kindle technical support said to turn the kindle dx sideways.	1
	lol.	1
	fix it please as i have until july 11th to return it for a full refund.	1
	the apple iphone does it, why can't the kindle.	1
	i keep hearing excuses from their technical support.	1
	for $500, why can't we have everything including books that come from the publisher properly formatted.	1
	qc by amazon is not up to par when it comes to this aspect.      	1
	kindle dx.i received my dx on friday, and i must say i'm impressed with it.	1
	the size is great.	1
	and, i downloaded my library from the archieves without any problems.	1
	the cover is just what this larger size reader needed.	1
	i really can't find a fault with it yet.	1
	so, when will we see it in color, and with a back light?      	1
	5 things should be upgraded without additional charge for users of kindle dx.1.	1
	page notes feature for pdf docs is unreasonably deleted.	1
	besides page bookmarks, page notes is very essential for serious reading and research on lengthy pdf docs.	1
	i could not figure out a reason for amazon to make such an ignorance.	1
	2.	1
	'tree structure' content table alongside page display is extremely essential for book reading, otherwise readers can not have sense of progress in term of chapters and sections.	1
	why does amazon want readers to read books having great difficulty in locating sections and chapters?	1
	3. why does amazon refuse to allow readers to establish one 'clipping' for each book?	1
	4. readers should have the rights to arrange their purchased books according to their own needs on book shelves (for an e-book reader, it means to establish reader's own directory, at least three self customized directories are necessary.	1
	5. more expensive kindle dx has much slower wireless website browsing than kindle 2 (i own both kindle dx and kindle 2).	1
	how can this happen?	1
	the above 5 intolerable problems actually make kindle dx a defective product!!!	1
	these things should have been overcome with no legal or technical barriers.	1
	why not?	1
	will any one here or amazon kindle dx designers give some explanations on these defects?	1
	why you intentionally preserve these bugs with your latest generation (2.5 generation)?	1
	as consumers, we have rights to ask and request a proper answer and repairs on those easy repairable bugs.	1
	the above mentioned bugs should be fixed without additional charge quickly for consumers of kindle dx.	1
	as an e-ink device backed with the largest online bookstore, amazon kindle does not encounter very strong competitors, i think that's why they do not need to feel guilty for those bugs.	1
	on the other hand, consumers have to wait and suffer from their ignorances.	1
	i have to wait and continue to use this defective product.	1
	it's useful and revolutionary in conception.	1
	that's why i give it 3 stars.	1
	waiting for reply, explanation and free upgrade of kindle dx software!!!	1
	!	1
	not for technical people.	1
	returned product.	1
	kindle dx is fanntastic.i have nothing but praise for this product.	1
	all of the features are just what i wanted to enjoy my reading.      	1
	don't wast you time thinking, purchase it..it is a very practical e-book reader.	1
	the only concern is how to convert your stuff to the kindle extension (file format) in an efficient way without loosing the original text format.	1
	in general, i highly recommend the kindle dx for you.      	1
	an avid reader, who loves this device..i have enjoyed my kindledx for 2 months.the size and availability to cary as many books with you, is fabulous.	1
	i think the machine is pricey, but worth the investment.	1
	its so easy, no going to stores, no checkout counters and the books are less than i can purchase them for elsewhere.      	1
	the more i use it the more i like it..my daughter in iraq bought the kindle dx for my birthday.	1
	she ordered it early since they are so hot they sell out.	1
	i love to read and after only a few moments of use it was true love.	1
	in fact, the more i use it, the more i like it.	1
	ha!	1
	some times i will put my shopping list or to do list on my kindle dx because it is with me wherever i go.	1
	best gift ever.      	1
	awesome resource.i love my dx!	1
	having all of my books in one place and very easy to get to is a resource that puts me way ahead to self improvement and knowledge.	1
	easy on the eyes to read, easy to highlight and take notes.	1
	the cost is high but when you think of the time saved and ease of use then it becomes a no-brainer.	1
	i love my dx!      	1
	billing problem.	1
	my 21st century e book.being an avid reader, i was collecting a large selection of books.	1
	with the kindle i don't have to worry about extra clutter!!	1
	the kindle is easy to hold, can be turned any direction and the text automatically adjusts, page turning is a click, a great dictionary, a place for notes, highlighting, and oh so much more.	1
	i really like that my book always lies flat and my most favorite feature is the kindle shop.	1
	i can browse for books hot off the press and download them in under 1 minute!!!!!!!	1
	!wow there are many accessories that can be purchased.	1
	i bought a beautiful fuchsia pebbled leather cover to protect my kindle.	1
	you will love your kindle as much as i do; just check out kindle!!!	1
	!      	1
	concerns about kindle.i am one of those voracious readers for whom kindle is intended and my crammed bookshelves bear mute witness to the fact-after all how can a reader throw away a friend?	1
	but, so far, i don't have the extra dollars needed for the kindle purchase.	1
	i, therefore, sit in envy at those of you with enough money at hand to have one!	1
	i will get there, just taking a bit longer before i get it!	1
	but i do have a concern.	1
	while it is true that there are many, many kindle books available at the reasonable price of $9.99 (i have been keeping track), and sometimes at even less, i have also started to notice some kindle prices at around $14.00.	1
	this make me wonder what the future will hold for kindle users.	1
	we (i count myself as i know i will get one soon) are really at the mercy of amazon.	1
	the kindle prices are going to go up, we all know, but just how high will they go?	1
	i often buy bestsellers second hand, admittedly waiting a while longer than i would like to get the book at a discount on a used book, but i have also saved myself a significant part of what the newly published book would cost.	1
	can i always be assured that amazon will be striving with us, the readers in mind, or am i going to find, in a few years, my kindle sitting on the shelf because i can buy a used copy of a book much more cheaply that the kindle edition costs?	1
	i hope i am totally wrong about this as i want a kindle.	1
	maybe santa will bring one!      	1
	top of the mart.	1
	daytime books okay, but not for aviation.	1
	pricing is confusing..i bought the dx for my wife and i.  i believed the landscape display would be useful if we bought a book with graphs and charts.	1
	so far i have bought one book and am enjoying reading it on the kindle.	1
	my wife asked about downloading a book she needed to read for an egypt history class.	1
	no luck on amazon.	1
	i heard an interesting interview with robert prechter so i looked up his book 'conquer the crash.'	1
	it is available in the kindle edition for $22.36.	1
	however, it is now out in an updated and expanded edition.	1
	so i looked for this edition on amazon.	1
	sure enough it also available...for $27.95 in hardcopy and on the kindle.	1
	however, i don't know if i buy the $27.95 edition for the kindle whether i will also receive the bonus cd-rom.	1
	my guess is not.	1
	so i go back to the original book and discover that i can buy it for $9.49 in hardcopy from a partner vendor.	1
	i note that 16% of the people who consider buying the original end up buying the updated edition.	1
	i wonder how many ended up buying the kindle edition.	1
	i sure didn't.      	1
	kindle dx.i purchased this for my husband who had a stroke.	1
	his eyesight and comprehesion level were affected.	1
	the print on the kindle is so clear and sharp that it has enabled him to read again.	1
	the more he reads, the better his comprehesion gets.	1
	it is so easy to handle and use.	1
	it has made a very big difference in his life.	1
	the only improvements i could suggest would be a better voice when reading the books.       	1
	3 devices for a paperless office.	1
	nice idea, but too big and too heavy for general reading.i bought the kindle 2 a few months ago, and while it was disappointing to see a new model come out so soon, and as a gadget guy, i gave in and ordered the dx.	1
	the unit arrived yesterday and before taking off the plastic screen cover, i noted how heavy the dx is and i minded that it didn't have buttons on the left side.	1
	the larger screen puts a lot of text to see, but does not give options to create columns.	1
	i my opinion, it is too much text at once where the columns or page turning on the kindle 2 gives you that second of a 'reading break' to let your eyes adjust.	1
	if you are a student and have texts books available, this would be great vs. carrying around a lot of heavy books.	1
	the landscape/portrait turn is very slow.	1
	not instantaneous like the iphone and at first i thought it did not work.	1
	i will be sending the dx back for a refund.	1
	for the right person, it could be a useful tool.	1
	for the casual reader of books and newspapers, it had far too many downsides to justify the new expense.	1
	given the fact that the wsj reported that amazon gets the lion share of book purchases and news paper fees, i think they need to step up the technological development, make this lighter (like other models being released in the coming year) and perhaps add a touch screen for page turning -- or a middle sized model between the 2 and dx.	1
	i do highly recommend the kindle 2, but with the same button quality on both the 2 and dx, i'd like to see amazon step up with better quality and feel buttons.	1
	last word (and perhaps its there) is allowing the user to turn on a clock when reading.	1
	on vacation, who cares about time, but when on a schedule ... it'd be nice!      	1
	the question is about censorship, and freedom of thought..when you buy a real book, you own that copy for as long as you want to.	1
	you can sell it on, lend it to a friend, read it as many times as you want.	1
	the kindle has none of these freedoms.	1
	you only have your book until amazon deletes it.	1
	which recently happened to those who, ironically, had bought george orwell's 1984.  not only that, but your drm-ed book will only be readable on the kindle, you don't own that copy.      	1
	a true convert!!	1
	!.i initially had a number of complaints about the kindle dx of which some remain.	1
	$500 is a lot of money and the mp3 player and browser have a lot to be desired.	1
	there was no expansion slot for an sd, no page buttons on the left side, etc.., etc..., etc...,, but i must say in all fairness that i have had my kindle dx since fathers day and i have absolutely fell in love with this device.	1
	i take it everywhere including the mall, work, the beach and everywhere else.	1
	i am in fact reading a wider variety of material daily and the battery life is unparalleled!!.	1
	with wireless on it will go several days and with the wireless off it will go more than a week.	1
	try that on your pc or your ithing.	1
	on long trips with the family i no longer haul around my laptop.	1
	i simply take my blackberry and my kindle.	1
	this device is great!	1
	!      	1
	very mixed feelings.	1
	unless you're wealthy, stay away..so sorry, amazon.	1
	i really wanted to like this thing, especially as it was a loving gift from my wife.	1
	in some respects it's excellent: the screen is easy to read, it's lightweight, and putting content on it is convenient.	1
	but here are the many reservations i have after a few days' use:1. make certain you do in fact have sprint 3g coverage before considering buying this.	1
	if you don't, the hassle factor is large and this becomes little more than a portable disk drive with a screen attached.2.	1
	the prices of books seem at first to be all $10.	1
	but it's not so.	1
	if a book is large or has illustrations, they will charge more and indeed the price nearly reaches the price of a standard print edition.3.	1
	in a book i bought, the illustrations were embedded as very low resolution .jpg images.	1
	this rendered them unreadable, which was a serious problem considering that this was a computer operating system reference book.	1
	i thought it would be a good idea to replace the heavy, fat reference book with the kindle, but it's not if i can't read it.	1
	more later, as i gain more experience.	1
	but first impressions last, and it does not seem like amazon has thoughtfully integrated their product with the 'content', and without doing so this bears no comparison to well one products (e.g.	1
	ipod).      	1
	will remotely remove your books..the kindle has the ability to remotely remove books you've purchased (at amazon's whim).	1
	this recently occurred with the books 1984 and animal farm.	1
	i would not purchase this product at any price.      	1
	kindle dx.i am very happy with the kindle.	1
	it works just as advertised.	1
	it is a little heavier than i expected, but that has not really been a problem.      	1
	2 problems.i'm using the new kindle dx and don't know where to submit suggestions, so i'll do it here and hope someone from the company reads it.	1
	(1) i buy books and subscriptions both for my business and for personal use, and have two different credit cards on amazon.com that i can one-click and easily charge to either credit card.	1
	that's impossible on the dx.	1
	the nice young woman at kindlesupport number tells me that i can only use one credit card for all purchases on the kindle, unless i go into my amazon.com screen and change my default setting everytime i want to order.	1
	(2)  the download of newspapers doesn't work overseas, which is one of the things i was most hoping to accomplish by buying this.	1
	again, the nice young woman in support tells me that the sprint 3g system in the kindle doesn't work overseas.	1
	that makes no sense to me, since my att 3g blackberry works just fine overseas.        	1
	kindle dx broke my heart..this past holiday season, my household was gifted with a new kindle dx.	1
	while i was dubious at first, the usefulness of the device soon won me over.	1
	things i liked about the kindle dx i am a voracious reader and frequent traveler.	1
	having access to dozens of books, a new york times subscription plus limited web access really put my mind at ease.	1
	i'm constantly afraid of running out of things to read while on a plane, and the kindle soothed my worries on that score.	1
	for some reason, i had not realized that e-books are offered at such a steep discount to their paper counterparts.	1
	this made the initial high price of the device much, much easier to stomach, at least for me.	1
	i know that i don't spend enough on books that getting deals for $9.99 will ever cause the kindle to pay for itself, but i appreciate the gesture on amazon's part anyway.	1
	portability.	1
	easy to carry, not too large or too small.	1
	i find a number of hand-held products appear to be designed for larger, more ham-handed persons than myself.	1
	this one felt just right.	1
	the full keyboard at the bottom of the screen is small, but perfectly useable.	1
	miraculously light and pleasant to hold.	1
	i loved sitting on an airplane and being able to read a four-hundred page novel without having a heavy book to lug around.	1
	long battery life.	1
	i had been reading from the kindle for a few hours a day, and did not need to charge it for over a week.	1
	i found the battery life especially satisfactory.	1
	there is an unobtrusive battery life symbol at the upper right-hand corner of the display which i found comforting.	1
	no surprise shut-down while you are in the middle of a sentence.i loved the appearance of the black and white e-ink display.	1
	it has a slightly etch-a-sketch quality that i found charming.	1
	the read-aloud voice sounds slightly, but not entirely, like stephen hawking, which i enjoyed.	1
	finding free books -- those in the public domain -- is a little difficult but not impossible.	1
	i downloaded most of the works of shakespeare on it for free.	1
	i liked some of the screensavers, especially the ones that looked like old-timey woodcuts.	1
	i enjoyed the mild sense of cognitive dissonance i got from seeing antique looking art on the high-tech screen.	1
	the area where i thought the kindle really shines is with newspaper and magazine subscriptions.	1
	i've always hated reading the newspaper, because of the oversize way that it is formatted.	1
	each sheet is huge and folding it and re-folding it, or even just holding it up to read, can be a full-contact sport, pretty much ensuring that it is impossible to read the newspaper and multi-task.	1
	i'm probably dating myself here, but before the advent of the internet, i preferred to get my news by reading weekly magazines such as newsweek or time, rather than the daily newspaper.	1
	the other thing that i dislike about newspapers (and magazines too) is the way that articles are frequently broken up, so that the valuable real-estate on the front page can be shared among as many stories as possible.	1
	i hate having to hunt for an article that is continued on one of the back pages.	1
	with the advent of [...], i never looked back.	1
	however, i feel the kindle is an even superior reading experience than getting news online for several reasons.	1
	reading new york times or the wall street journal on the kindle gave me a sense of completeness that you'll never get from the web.	1
	it gave me the sensation of having read the paper 'cover to cover' whereas, on the web, the content may have been shifted around and you're never really sure if you got everything.	1
	no more annoying story breaks, or awkward page turns, as you'd find in a print version.	1
	the magazine size of the kindle was ideal.	1
	each newspaper article has a 'next article' button at the bottom of the page, accessible by the mini-joystick, so you can easily skip through articles you don't want to read.	1
	the menu option on the newspaper allows you to see each 'section' of the paper, opinion, sports, local, entertainment, etc.	1
	and read all articles in that section, or choose articles one by one.	1
	best of all, no advertising of any sort.	1
	i can't think of any other format that can boast that.	1
	this is my new, number one, preferred way to access the news.	1
	now for the bad news.	1
	things i didn't like about the kindle dx page turns seemed a tad slow to me.	1
	i'm a fast reader, and like to read the final sentence on a page right as i'm turning the page.	1
	it took me a good while to get the knack of pressing the 'next page' button at just the right time.	1
	even then, i felt like i was waiting half a second in-between each page for the new one to load.	1
	it's an odd sort of pause that i wouldn't have while reading a normal book.	1
	the interface on the home page seems a bit clunky and old-school looking.	1
	that in and of itself wasn't a problem, but it did make finding special features rather difficult.	1
	the read-aloud feature isn't available on most things.	1
	as i understand it, amazon had planned to include it for nearly all content, but was blocked by some publishers who didn't want to hurt audiobook sales.	1
	you have to pay for access to blogs.	1
	ridiculous!	1
	they're available on the internet for free.	1
	after fiddling with it for over a week, i still couldn't figure out how to load pdf's on it or sync it with an iphone.	1
	i'm a pretty tech-saavy person.	1
	i was surprised that this stumped me.	1
	having an iphone, i'm so used to having a touch screen on a hand-held device.	1
	i kept stupidly touching the screen, before remembering that it's not a touch screen.	1
	again, being so used to reading things online, even though i knew that the e-ink display was designed to be easier on the eyes, i kept finding myself being surprised by having to turn on a reading light or not be able to read the thing in the dark.it took me a little over a week to notice this, but all the fonts are the same.	1
	i'm not such a font-hound that i could name the font the kindle uses off the top of my head, but it seems like an obscure one.	1
	i kind of missed seeing different typography in different books.	1
	it seemed to me that the newer the title, the greater the likelihood of spelling errors and strange formatting mistakes such as spaces in the middle of a word.	1
	unlike real books, you cannot share titles you've purchased with your friends.	1
	annoyingly, i could not figure out how to turn off the screen rotation.	1
	sometimes, i like to curl up on my side while reading, and the kindle dx rendered this impossible, as it always wanted to 'correct' itself and be read right side up, no matter which way i turned it.	1
	i noticed that out of all of the famous authors featured on the screensavers, none of them were people of color.	1
	i would have loved it if langston hughes, phyllis wheatley, and other authors had been featured alongside oscar wilde, emily dickinson and others.	1
	also!	1
	once and again, a screensaver would come up that was an ad for kindle.	1
	lame, in my opinion.	1
	one more thing bothered me -- and this may be silly, i know.	1
	i was concerned that i felt there was anything about the kindle to criticize, let alone so many.	1
	my internal critic was telling me, 'wah, wah, wah, tell me more about your first world problems.'	1
	it's such an amazing thing to have so much reading material in such a slim, easy to carry device.	1
	you know those status reports that captain picard reads?	1
	it felt like i was reading one of those.	1
	like i'm living in the future!	1
	so, i was disappointed in myself, that i found so many faults to pick with it.	1
	update: as i was writing this review this weekend, the kindle dx suddenly died.	1
	at first the screen was frozen on the screensaver.	1
	i assumed that it might need charging up.	1
	when i plugged it in overnight, the screen went white.	1
	after rebooting it, the screen was covered in scratchy lines and garbled half-images of the screensaver.	1
	after rebooting it again, i briefly got it to work again, but it quickly pooped out.	1
	i am so disappointed.	1
	i was just starting to fall in love with it, and now, suddenly it's gone.	1
	at the moment i realized the kindle wasn't working, it suddenly struck me how many hundreds of unread pages lay trapped inside.	1
	how sad!	1
	even more concerning, i'm worried that amazon may play hardball and refuse to replace the broken device.	1
	check out all the other one-star ratings and you'll see what i mean.	1
	apparently this is a not uncommon problem, which they have been very reluctant to address.	1
	not cool, amazon.	1
	not cool at all.	1
	initial rating: 3 stars.	1
	i took away one for the minor quibbles i had with it, and another for the high price and proprietary manner in which amazon lets you access materials.final rating:  one star.	1
	for being so flimsy (screen died after only a month), for reputed poor customer service and for breaking my heart.      	1
	blows - navigation sucks, drm issues, and over priced books..* no folders means that if you have many books, navigation is a nightmare.	1
	* drm issues cause some books to be unreadable.	1
	* the biggest problem is the cost of books.	1
	a printed book cost about $2 to print.	1
	and often sells for $20.	1
	many kindle books are just under the print version.	1
	and while this saves me some money, the cost of the kindle should be off-set by the reduced kindle book cost.	1
	hopefully, the b&n; nook will spur a price war in the industry and we will see kindle books drop in price.       	1
	awesome product.right from the very moment i got the neatly packed kindle dx, i was thrilled.amazon is a customer delighting company.	1
	kindle dx was shipped on time, packaging was g8 and the whole unboxing gave me  a apple product like feeling.	1
	very neatly done.	1
	kindle dx is a g8 device for some one like me who likes to read a lot.	1
	i have a personal collections of pdf books.	1
	it was easy to copy my pdf files in kindle, just drag and drop in kindle folder.	1
	books showed in main page on kindle.	1
	pdf rendering is very good and fast.	1
	books with lot of images took a little more time to move to next page.	1
	normal text page with black and white font render very fast.	1
	my first impression about kindle is wow , amazon has made a excellent product and platform which can change the way we look at e-books and reading in general.	1
	congratulations  amazon !!	1
	very satisfied customer..      	1
	great product, one minor usability gripe.i love reading books off of my new kindle dx.	1
	however, i had trouble figuring out how to delete a book once i was done with it.	1
	the menu system has no option for deleting books, and the user guide fails to address it.	1
	i had to use google to find the procedure (select the book on the home page and then move the 5-way button to the left).	1
	of course, this is no longer a problem now that i know what to do.	1
	having to go to the documentation for a basic operation like delete is weak usability, but to go there and find nothing is unacceptable.	1
	who knows?	1
	maybe the instructions are there, but the writer chose not to use an obvious verb like 'delete' that would show up in a search.      	1
	marketing failure.the kindle, exactly what i was looking for.	1
	ebook reader, e-ink, big market share.	1
	*cheers* but the display was too small, so i was desperately waiting for a bigger screen... well, after months of waiting, finally the dx was released.	1
	however, no coverage of germany, no global version.	1
	i was in the states back the days, but buying the kindle dx there was pointless, as there was no german bookstore, and no german 3g-offering by amazon.	1
	so again, i was desperately waiting for a global dx version.	1
	well, after some more months of waiting, finally the global version of the dx was released.	1
	however, still no german bookstore, however, even no german (or global) adapter.	1
	but at least a global version, available not at amazon.de, but .com.	1
	well, after some thinking, i decided to buy it.	1
	it may be ok starting with the english books.	1
	still, it costed a hell lot of money (489), lots of people claimed it was not worth it, but anyway, i deceided to buy it.	1
	logging into amazon.com... clicking the buy button... but wait.... instead of 489 dollars, it costed more?	1
	a lot more...  30 dollars shipping.... 120 dollars tax.... making up a total of 620 dollars!	1
	wait!	1
	this feels like buying something for 489 dollars worth, and throwing 150 dollars out of the windows.	1
	cancel!	1
	bottom line: a global player like amazon, failing completely in offering a product like the kindle to the global markets.	1
	incredible.and we are not talking about a 'one-second-global-release', we are talking about a global strategy that failed for years.	1
	just having a good idea - worthless without realizing it in real life.   	1
	difficult to read in the dark.my major complaint about the smaller kindle i own is that it has no backlight.	1
	i do most of my reading in bed at night next to my sleeping wife.	1
	it's impractical to use the clip-on light or other hand-held light since any of these is too bright and intrusive for my sleeping spouse.	1
	what i'd like to see is a backlit screen feature that has adjustable brightness, with a low setting that allows just enough brightness to discern the text and a higher setting that will allow reading in a any dark environment in which keeping someone awake isn't an issue.	1
	this feature would also eliminate the need to hold another device while reading.additionally, i'd prefer a rubberized, non-slip backing that will prevent slippage while leaning the device at an angle on a slippery surface.      	1
	a good product.	1
	understanding innovation.my rating is based upon my understanding of the technology and not my ownership of the device.	1
	i am posting a review of the digital reading devices as i own the sony digital reader and have been considering the kindle.	1
	i have read several of the reviews from the site and i am basing my decision on possibly purchase the kindle on but a few conditions: 1) many of you complain that the kindle is ergonomically inadequate.	1
	it too large, its to heavy, blah, blah, blah.	1
	kudos goes to the kindle for thinness and removing the bulk from carrying alot of books around when you are reading multiple books at one time as i do.	1
	i personally do not hold my books for long periods of time when i read and occassionally may opt to hold a warm coffee cup while placing my books on a table while i read.	1
	laying the kindle on a table or desktop serves this function perfectly 2) file structure for organizing books: last i remember, libraries primarily organized books by one of two ways: 1) author and 2) title.	1
	the kindle is a reading device not an mp3 player.	1
	if you want folders buy an ipod and listent to audio books.	1
	stop complaining about what the kindle is not and appreciate it for what it is.	1
	i think folders are a great option considering that the device does manage multiple file formats but does anyone in these reviews currently own over 3500 books on their kindle.	1
	and to the man who is trying to use the kindle to reorganize his complete pdf library of files.	1
	it seems to me like you should possible consider buying a tablet pc and didn't research the kindle for it capabilities in this area of document support.	1
	3) about pdf: again i own the sony digital reader and no reader device to date that i know of display pdf with complete accuracy and precision to the original document.i think this is something that will need tweeking in later versions of this technology.	1
	i will probably order it and test drive it for thirty day to make certain is suits me needs but overall i think the kindle sound like a winner for the regular joe who wants to read multiple book at the same time without the bulk.   	1
	an ok reader that did not get the (first time) amazon credit card discount!.	1
	i love it.	1
	one change.i have been using one on loan from a friend.	1
	i like, but not love it.	1
	the thing they could do that would make me buy one, that would make me give up traditional books is make it waterproof.ps the leather cover with the magnets is really nice and does great at protecting your kindle.      	1
	please amazon, bring this great product to europe.for the moment nobody in europe can buy this great product because it's not possible to buy the kindle books.	1
	the reason i don't understand, but everybody is waiting for it!	1
	it would be a dream to be able to download books straight into your kindle.      	1
	love my dx.my dx is absolutely amazing!!!	1
	i take it everywhere i go and show it to everyone.	1
	iwish i had purchased a kindle sooner.	1
	my only complaint is that i cannot access whispernet in my hometown or county.	1
	i must travel 20-25 minutes north to a county that has a sprint tower.	1
	if there is anyone in this area that would like to see a kindle i can be reached at    sbb07@charter.net      	1
	color for kindle.i like the dx but i'd like to see more color than just black, grey, & white      	1
	mom of dyslexic reader.could you help me decide whether to buy the kindle 2 or kindle dx?	1
	i have a soon to be starting high schooler and i would like to use the kindle as a text reader for my dyslexic daughter.	1
	the challenge is the text books.	1
	i would like her text books read to her using kindle.	1
	any advice?	1
	thank you!      	1
	amazing!!	1
	!.what can i say, this is the most ingenious piece of electronic equipment i've seen in a long time.	1
	way better then an ipod!!!	1
	very user friendly, and so much easier for packing for trips, when i would normally pack multiple books and magazines.	1
	now i have them here it what is really the size of a  note pad.      	1
	warning to potential purchasers..you don't actually own any of the ebooks you think you have bought.what you have paid for is a 'license' to read the books: as long as amazon allows you to, under the conditions that amazon sets.	1
	you don't even have control over the device: amazon does.	1
	for example, they recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission (google 'amazon 1984' if you don't believe me!	1
	). 	1
	content?.	1
	love it.i just got mine on friday.	1
	this is the first kindle that i have bought.	1
	it is great.	1
	i was able to use it right from the box.	1
	i have downloaded several books and have been able to read at home, in the car and in bed.	1
	love the dictionary feature and look forward to exploring the web wiki.	1
	the large screen is a plus.	1
	i feel like i need a 'don't panic' sticker for the front cover.	1
	(gratuitous hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy reference for those that haven't read it).       	1
	an ellegant device.the kindle dx is an excellent, if pricy, ebook reader.	1
	i still long for a back lighting feature that makes it easy to read in bed and in low-light settings.	1
	i also wish that more magazines, such as the economist were available on kindle.	1
	i find the next page key (the key you push the most) to be a bit sticky/ difficult to engage.	1
	you don't want it to click over too easily, but also want to make sure that it turns with a solid push.i have been bought into the concept of e-books for 10 years, begining with the rocket e-book, and through the sony e-readers.	1
	the kindle dx is certainly the best in class at this point.at a price point of $500, it seems that the unit should be sold with some sort of protective cover, which is absolutely neccesary for the device.	1
	the 'official' amazon cover costs an additional $50, (which is over priced).      	1
	absolutely love my kindle.i absolutely love my new kindle dx global.	1
	just received it about a week ago and recently got to use it on a trip with many flights.....a must have for the frequent fliers like myself.	1
	i've read three books now, started on number four.	1
	very easy to read....i keep finding myself trying to turn the page like on a real book.	1
	the battery life is fantastic, only wish my cell phone had half the time as the kindle.	1
	there are plenty of other features that i've just began to explore, like the web browser, which is good, not great, but is still 'experimental'.	1
	the only real issue i have is the poor category options on the home screen....i already have over a dozen books and i can see as i add more, it will become very difficult to sort through them.....i did email amazon and received a very quick personal reply.....i feel confident that a new category option will be coming down the pike, hope so!	1
	i'd give the kindle a five-star review, but as mentioned, the category option is weak.	1
	i'll be happy to re-review once they update the category option in the home screen (hint to amazon techs).	1
	i bought the kindle because i travel quite a bit and wanted to start reading more.	1
	anyone wanting to read more, more often, and perhaps skeptical about e-readers, i don't think you'll be more satisfied than with the kindle..i highly recommend this product.      	1
	it's for me!	1
	*-).best buy on amazon and so happy i own this.	1
	i would and will buy again for others.      	1
	no left side advance.	1
	kindle dx.	1
	disappointed.i was disappointed with the awkward feel of this reading device.	1
	it's too big and one would think if you need something like this go ahead and purchase a netbook.	1
	i also was uncomfortable with the display.	1
	i like having a lot of light when i read and there is no backlight on the device.        	1
	kindle dx.	1
	it is good but not very good..i got my kindle dx(kdx) 3 hours ago.	1
	i give it 4 stars because its features as amazon described is.	1
	but i don't like the way that amazon organize the books and documents.	1
	i have to find my books and documents line by line.	1
	i create a folder in kdx and move my pdf documents from my laptop.	1
	however, i can not find the way to read those pdf files( i don't know either i don't know the mathod or kdx does not support multple folder ).	1
	the other think that kdx missing, is not support chinese font or unicode.	1
	it is a big drawback.	1
	the device is made by either taiwan or china but it does not support chinese font.	1
	i am trying to order computer or technology magazines, but i found that there is no such magazine on the list.	1
	even my first order of the new york times does not include the technology section, which i read on-line every day.	1
	i ordered the kdx leather cover too.	1
	the cover design perfect for the kindle dx, but it is heavy when put the kdx together.	1
	a protection film is must have for the kdx.	1
	when i check the price from amazon store, it costs $[...] plus shipping.	1
	it is expensive for just a plastic film.	1
	it is difficult to put it on too.	1
	one other think, the kdx web browser is not good, don't expect it is like iphone's browser.	1
	before apple release its tablet version macbook, i think that kdx is the best device for reading.	1
	overall, the kdx is not perfect, but i still recomand it is good for a reading device.	1
	because it is the only technology we can choose.      	1
	but i don't want amazon sticking their nose in or tampering with my stuff..looks great, but as long as amazon locks down and controls the device and can delete my books and personal notes, i think not.	1
	i simply don't buy drm.	1
	i can already hear someone saying i shouldn't care about drm unless i am doing something illegal, but you can quickly see this is absurd.	1
	drm is an assault on freedom, with a great potential for abuse, misuse, and malfunction.	1
	just say no to drm.      	1
	love it!!!	1
	!.a friend of mine has the kindle 2 and it is nice.	1
	so i decieded to get the kindle dx and i just love it.	1
	it is so easy for me to read.	1
	i love the bigger screen it makes for easy reading!	1
	!      	1
	this is the kindle for everyone.	1
	dr t turrentine.i just opened and started using the kindle for the first time.	1
	wow.. it far exceeds my expectations.	1
	i am so looking forward to both leisure and professional literature on the same venue.	1
	can't wait for the color so my professional needs are met better.	1
	until then i will just enjoy my new reading pleasure.	1
	great technology.the upside: the kindle dx is amazing.	1
	it allows me to read pdfs and books in a light, easy to read device.	1
	i think you will actually find yourself reading more.	1
	the downside:  the fact that amazon can magically delete purchased books via whispernet is incredibly unsettling.	1
	lest you are unaware, you never really own the content you buy on your kindle.	1
	amazon's action on this regard (see nytimes article below) has made me rethink how much content i will buy for the kindle now.	1
	one time fiction:  sure.	1
	more nuanced books that you need to go back to for information or even inspiration:  no.	1
	amazon screwed the pooch on that one... [...]      	1
	disappointed.while the divice itself works fine and could be a wonderful asset, the failure is in the lack of available books.	1
	this is especially true in non fiction works though for some authors the fiction selection is lacking as well.	1
	save your money and buy  the books themselves.	1
	at least that way you can get what you want to read and not just what is available.      	1
	crippled, display lag & slow.	1
	not trading freedoms for 'sexy'.i absolutely love the idea of having a library of books with me wherever i go.	1
	i love the choice of reading whatever book wherever i want, whenever i want and not have to search out a bookstore to purchase a book.	1
	amazon provides this service very well.	1
	the problem with the kindle is its restriction on user freedom.	1
	when i 'purchase' and ebook from amazon, i do not own the book in the same way i own a physical book.	1
	i am not free to read it wherever i want (on any device i choose) nor can i give it away, share it with my friends, donate it or sell it.	1
	the user is entirely at the mercy of the distributor.	1
	recently, amazon invaded users' kindles and removed books that the publisher decider they no longer want published.	1
	it would be a public outrage if your house was invaded and your beloved books were torn from your shelf because the publisher decided your time was up for ownership so why do we allow this to happen in the digital realm?	1
	i really look forward to owning an ereader but i'm not going to trade my freedoms for 'sexy'.      	1
	fantastic device with one fatal flaw.i had a prs 505 before i bought the dx.	1
	after they announced it, i sold my prs immediately and put myself on the preorder list for the dx.	1
	it is partially my fault that i bought the device without doing the research i should have.	1
	the dx is touted heavily for the pdf functionality and larger screen.	1
	well, i read a lot of technical documents as well as textbooks i have in pdf format.	1
	the reading on this is superb.	1
	great balance in size vs. readability (compared to full a4).	1
	however, i bought this mainly for pdf support, which is why most people are going to pay the high price for.	1
	the main issue is that the kindle does not support the table of contents in pdf's.	1
	i was astonished that this is supposed to be a textbook replacement device.	1
	the table of contents on a pdf which is 1100 pages+ is a must and i am amazed they did add this easy and common functionality.	1
	i am going to be returning this device as soon as i can and am going to buy the prs 505 again.	1
	the screen might be smaller, but considering you can get one new for $[...] [...], the 350 dollars saved (after you include the cost of the [...] dollars book cover for the kindle, the [...] comes with one) is well worth it.	1
	the slight inconvenience of having to rotate the [...] screen to view pdfs isn't really all that bad.	1
	[...]      	1
	a lot to love, but a few big problems.this is my first kindle.	1
	i love a lot about it...i love the large screen size and the ability to read it in bright light.	1
	i love the 3g connection.	1
	i love the portability.	1
	i love the storage space.	1
	i hate that you can't disable the function that changes the screen from portrait to landscape.	1
	as someone who likes to read in bed at night...it makes it tough to change positions without having to hold the screen in an awkward manner to keep the screen orientation from changing.	1
	a simple way to disable this feature would make the dx much more lovable from my point of view.	1
	i also find that there isn't a good way to hold the thing with two hands without inadvertently hitting the page forward button.	1
	there isn't a lot of 'unused real estate' where you aren't accidentally hitting some button.	1
	overall, i'm glad i made the purchase.	1
	i like the flexibility it offers and the trees it saves.      	1
	over-rated.	1
	the amazon kindle dx - not for the vision impaired.	1
	re-kindles my love of trashy books.i wanted to love the kindle, but instead i only like it.	1
	it's bigger, it doesn't flicker, it's perfect for vacation books, but it also just doesn't satisfy me the way that curling up with a book does.	1
	don't get me wrong, it is perfect for downloading trashy romance books that i'm embarrassed for my husband to know i still read, but it's just doesn't satisfy me the way that a great book does.       	1
	waiting for kindle in color.kindle is an excellent product.	1
	i am waiting to invest in a color form of kindle---the beauty of color makes the reader's experience even more exciting and realistic.	1
	hopefully the makers of kindle will provide us with a kindle in color product soon.	1
	thank you!	1
	terrific, even if it is expensive.	1
	overpriced underachiever.	1
	mixed bag at this price.i bought the kindle dx for my 10 year old.	1
	pros- the occasional wireless access use is very workable for a kid who does not have her own iphone/cell plan.	1
	she reads her email.- she is building up her vocabulary fast because she looks up words much more often now that when she was reading on paper- the books i order for my kindle are accessible on my other daughter's iphone- the battery holds up charge for several days- bright daylight performance of the screen is excellent- the tilt function is great   cons- just experienced a 2 hour outage due to 'server upgrades' that caused the much vaunted '1 minute download' to be out for arbitrary period of time.	1
	a digital order placed from the device showed up as 'being processed' for half an hour.	1
	i had to call to figure out that there was a genuine outage not anything wrong with my account.	1
	it is their policy that they do not want to let their customers know when there is an outage!- cannot read google books easily on my kindle.	1
	this is a major pain as there is much copyright-expired content that i want in addition to the paid drm content i buy.      	1
	holds over 3,000 books, documents, and newspapers, pretty sweet!!!	1
	!.this is a wonderful a++++ product.	1
	wireless, therefore you get the book delivered quick.knowledge is power!	1
	the good thing is, the battery has a long life.one would think that only a certain amount of books would be available for kindle dx, but no, there areover 340,000 books and newspapers and magazines!!!	1
	you can even download blogs.	1
	there is 4gb of storage in the kindle dx and the product is 1/3 of and inch thick!, now that is awesome.i can guarantee that the kindle dx is well worth the price.	1
	just think about it, all of your favorite booksand so much more at the tip of your fingertips!      	1
	i always loved e-book idea.	1
	but... amazon books should also consider.a) usually we are buing books by title and/or author and/or theme or category.we do not buy a book looking for what is available to a reading device we may haveso i propose in amazon books an icon to be introduced and displayed where each book is presented indicating that this book is also available for kindle.	1
	in that way i may value and decide to buy one kindle.	1
	b) usually people share and exchange or boroughs books they ownkindle amazon reader will allow readers to exchange books?	1
	thank you.       	1
	a new toy.bought a new dx its nice but i sure would like to have a better manual to thumb through its nice to read on the kindel but some time it better to just have a manual to read in the tub ( does the kindel float ??)	1
	right now i,m a little lost on e mail  where do you read it ??	1
	i bought a sub to a couple magazine s do you need to   delete them some where  after you read them ?	1
	same way as kindel blog??	1
	i guess i need a  dummies for kindel dx...i thought i could download my book of home made guitar music ( about 500 pages) and be able to find them via page number  has any one done this ??	1
	?right now i dont no if the kindel is worth the money i  spent      	1
	way too expensive from uk.by the time you've added shipping & handling as well as the import fees this product has shot up to $599.23 (around 360) to buy from the uk.	1
	thats a bit steep and way above the price in the us.	1
	considering the web browser doesn't work, and we can't access the complete range of books, it seems even less attractive.	1
	i'm really surprised amazon haven't tried to make the price in europe match the us price closer (for the books too), especially given then attractive alternatives that competitors are releasing.	1
	thats not to say the kindle isn't a great device, when i tried one i really liked it.	1
	however after making us wait so long and then charging us such a premium i can't help feeling that the kindle doesn't really deserve to succeed in europe.      	1
	old kindle dx:  domestic vs. global wireless access.	1
	why no sd card slot?.for a higher price than competition, i wonder why the device doesn't have an sd card slot as so many others do?	1
	i tend to read a lot of reference material already in pdf format, and while traveling i often need to reference something burried in a laptop that i need to boot up and then power down again.	1
	now, if read off an sd card i'd gladly carry a kindle instead of my laptop, but there is no sd card slot, why would anyone want this when there are better/more options with other readers, namely an sd card slot.	1
	i refuse to buy a kindle until they add an sd card slot.      	1
	i don't suggest kindle dx for a techie!!	1
	not worth buying!.i had lot of expectations before buying and after reading the kindle reviews on amazon.	1
	+ves 1) paper like reading.	1
	this is the best and i liked most.	1
	2) good battery and again not as specifications.	1
	not lasting as mentioned in specs 3) size 4) faster docs delivery   -ves 1) not all pdf files are dx compatable.	1
	i am not able to use dx features for ebooks.	1
	even if i covert to dx compatable, after conversion all text and images are realligned, which makes un-redable.	1
	worst thing is few images are whiped off after conversion.	1
	2) pdf navigation is very poor.	1
	i am not able to quickly navigate.	1
	3) poor performance 4) sometime screen hangs when navigating pdf docs.	1
	5) poor online shopping features.	1
	i cannot even review my order before i place it.	1
	order will be placed without confirmation.	1
	6) when amazon says, inbuild pdf support it should support all the 'valid' pdf docs.	1
	i mean ebooks.	1
	not supporting.	1
	7# navigation within pdf is poor.	1
	i cannot get/buy all books i need @ kindle store.	1
	so i purchased ebooks @ difffent stores #like orielly#.	1
	but finally when i convert to dx compatable, all the actual pdf formatting is gone.	1
	and reading becomes really tough.	1
	finally i decided to return dx in a week.	1
	amazon need to seriously look @ the performance features and pdf support features.	1
	i expect next kindle release will have better performance with touch screen and better navigation features.	1
	i can suggest this ebook reader only for readers who buy books on kindle store and can compromise on performance.      	1
	great investment!.	1
	dissappointed.	1
	dx is to expensive.i would like to get the dx however, it is simply to expensive.	1
	if you compare the benefits of the dx to the regular version you are not getting much more and it cost $230 more?	1
	this makes no sense.	1
	amazone has lowered the price on the kindle2 twice and it is now $259, yet they still have the original price of $489 on the dx.	1
	i know i have a choice but the larger screen is a big deal for me so i will either wait it out or come up with another alternative.      	1
	only 1 credit card can be used for purchases.	1
	if you are not a computer geek - skip the kindle dx.	1
	deserves more than 5 stars !	1
	!	1
	!	1
	!	1
	!	1
	!.i just received my kindle dx and i love it !	1
	!	1
	!	1
	i highly recommend kindle dx (if you can't get a dx get an earlier model).	1
	it is comfortable to hold and read.	1
	try it - you'll like it      	1
	more pdf functionality!	1
	!.amazon - pdf is almost there.	1
	if you want this to be the 'killer app' add the functionality you have for books (text size, zoom, dictionary).	1
	other then the lack of pdf functionality, this is the best kindle yet.      	1
	take care.	1
	love my kindle, amazon customer service, not so much!.i love my new kindle dx.	1
	it really is all that it claimed to be and lives up to the positive reviews i read before buying it.	1
	thank goodness the product is so great, because amazon customer service after my purchase was terrible.	1
	but i got through that, and am looking forward to my continued dx experience.       	1
	an interested customer.i am a graduate student in mass communications and i have stacks of technical papers all around my office, car, and home.	1
	i just wanted to say that if amazon adds some pdf viewing options to the kindle dx, or comes out with a new kindle that possesses a better pdf viewer (with zoom functions) and a support for word documents, i would invest in a kindle and know of several other graduate students who would do the same.	1
	thanks.      	1
	interesting.as a professional computer geek, i'm kinda jaded when the next change the world technology comes along.	1
	so, i didn't want to touch the kindle with my own money, and i didn't.a school that i contract with insisted over my objections that i evaluate the kindle dx as a potential tool for special education.	1
	they will get the evaluation tomorrow, amazon gets it today.	1
	first the pros.	1
	1. this is cool.	1
	the ability to carry multiple books around with minimal bulk cannot be over stated.	1
	being able to switch from one book to another without even digging into a bag is ubercool.	1
	2. the screen is nice and clear, the ability to change text size is nice, and the way the page formatting changes with the text size is nice because you do not have to scroll as the text gets larger.	1
	ok, now the cons... 1. you want how much for this thing?	1
	i realize that part of the price is to support the cost of the wireless service, but come on boost the price by a quarter a book and drop the cost of the kindle to $100.	1
	you'll make way more money in the long run.	1
	you can only play the green crud for so much before you run out of people willing to pay through the nose for a status symbol.	1
	you can get a nice entry level laptop or netbook for the price of the kindle.	1
	2. nice keyboard.	1
	why no apps?	1
	open office seems made for this sort of application.	1
	3. no backlight.	1
	i realize that is probably intentional, but it will become an issue.	1
	4. the screensaver.	1
	yaeh, right... it actually eats up power by transforming the eink to a stock picture, one that i did not pick and have no control over.	1
	realistically, i want to have control over it and choose if i want my own pics and if it activates at all.	1
	5. file compatibility.	1
	why aren't word and rtf supported?	1
	is text?	1
	come on, these are no brainers.	1
	overall, i like it, but i know it will be about 2 years before i purchase a kindle for my own use.	1
	at that time i expect a third generation kindle to come out at a much lower price point.	1
	i would also expect a lot more usability out of the device.      	1
	mixed bag.it seems whenever technology would extend consumer capabilities, the monopolists who own it instead reduce them.	1
	drm is a pain in the neck removing resale and lending ability.	1
	page numbers are unclear.	1
	simple steps like going to the end of a chapter (or knowing what chapter you are in) become complicated.	1
	checking references becomes tedious.	1
	on the other hand it is light, very readable, and cheaper to get materials (if they are available).	1
	whispernet is nothing but a crippling nuisance if you are not in the area - you can't activate the device without it.	1
	i got this because i need to carry a lot of books with me and i can include pdfs (with limited functionality).	1
	it does that, and it works great for this purpose.	1
	it has convinced me that apple needs to make a tablet and that consumers need to vote open source whenever available.	1
	this device would be great if it wasn't designed around marketing (rather than real usability studies for academic users), closed platform development, and treating the consumer like a potential criminal.	1
	also don't leave it on your car seat when you drive or it will go flying into the dashboard when you stop.      	1
	to big.to big for taking it with me evey day i can not put it in my handbagin a place with little light i could not read       	1
	too much drm.while the rights to distribute to george orwell books were not owned by mobilereference, it still seems wrong to me that amazon should delete the copies from devices.	1
	in fact, amazon should not be able to exercise this right.	1
	just because being digital allows you to have greater 'big brother' control over things, does not mean that that power should be used.	1
	if it turned out that the hard copies of this book which people had bought were not legitimate, amazon would not be able to ask for all of those books back.	1
	amazon, this was your mistake, you should not take it out on your customers.	1
	i find it rather unfortunate that you have chosen to use such strong drm on this product.	1
	i use the amazon mp3 store for all of my music purchases, and the only reason i use this over other online stores by other companies is because you use no drm on your store.	1
	when i purchase a song, i can do whatever i want with it.	1
	it cannot be taken away, and it will always work on my computer even if i change it.	1
	why can't you have a unified company philosophy?      	1
	i'm very pleased, except with the ibd.this morning i'm playing with my new dx.	1
	overall, i'm very happy.	1
	i will have no difficulty reading books on the dx.	1
	however, i do have one complaint about my subscription to the newspaper investor's business daily.	1
	i bought the kindle dx specifically for the ibd and reading books is a big bonus for me.	1
	however, the ibd subscription is not a complete paper.	1
	all the stock quotes are left out and only the written articles are in the kindle subscription version.	1
	i need those stock quotes and stock ratings from the ibd.	1
	a paper subscription to the ibd is about $295 a year.	1
	i thought i was saving money to buy the kindle and get a subscription for $5.99 a month.	1
	now, if i have to subscribe anyhow, i'm a couple of hundred in the hole from what i intended to do.	1
	i guess i'll complain to the ibd and amazon and maybe someone can talk w.j.	1
	o'neil into adding the stocks into the kindle version of the paper.	1
	and, yes i would pay a little more for the subscription if it contained the additional info.      	1
	have my dx for under a day and already love it to death!!	1
	!.	1
	too expensive, too few titles, too hard to use.	1
	not worth the price.i tried the kindle and ended up returning it.	1
	for the price, it just wasn't worth it.	1
	most of the newspapers and magazine subscriptions do not provide much more information than you can get on their websites.	1
	i bought a book (atlas shrugged) and amazon deleted it later with no explanation.	1
	there is no backlight to the device so if you want to read it in low light, you need a clip-on booklight.	1
	it's a cool, fun gadget, but at the end of the day i didn't feel like it worth almost $500 and then another $40 to $50 in monthly subscriptions.      	1
	out of the box - not a mac.	1
	kindle dx battery issues.this is someone who has bought every version of the kindle.	1
	i am sad to report that the dx has a major battery issue in which a two day charge is not sufficient to eliminate the 'critical battery' screen.	1
	looks like an issue with mine, but perhaps others have had this occur?	1
	don't try to find something online; amazon is showing it doesn't know consumer electronics.. maybe apple will bring out the ultimate machine when it previews its new tablet soon.	1
	this machine is not worth the money for the hassle of trying to find a fix.      	1
	kindle was ok but whisper net was poor.i ordered the kindle dx.	1
	looked good.	1
	a bit bigger than was comfortable.	1
	the wispernet that was used to connect to amazon was so lacking i had to send it back.	1
	i could connect with all the other carriers from my home on both computer and phone but whispernet (sprint) was impossible to use.	1
	i was sad.	1
	i wanted badly to use and enjoy the kindle and its bells and whistles without having to connect through a usb port.      	1
	kindle3dx.	1
	kindle.	1
	book should be lighetre than this.	1
	english please.	1
	for this format you need color.i can see the smaller kindle for reading text mostly.	1
	when the screen size gets as large as the dx, expectations for display change from mostly text to full color.	1
	i will not buy anything like this until it supports full color -- not just shades of gray.        	1
	kindle dx not very happy with this purchase.first the audio on the kindle is not great and it reads back the text slowly.	1
	i think this was a good purchase, but it of had a way for your slow down the playback for text speech to speech or speed it up.	1
	you are also not able get to a pdf very easily.	1
	part of reason i bought the kindle instead of the nook was for it's ease to read pdf's and it is not very easy to navigate through a pdf.      	1
	expensive and not perfect.pros :- great battery life- slick and compact  cons : - easy of transferring doc from pc not so good (would have loved to have a simple ui to manage this)- page transition effect (back screen) is disturbing - would like to easily zoom in /out      	1
	not for college..i have been watching this device and reading about it for months now, and everything sounds good as far as reading books and newspapers go, but as a college student i would love for my text books to be available on the kindle.	1
	it's very hard carrying around big college text books and would be great if i can have them all on just one device.	1
	also it would be nice to have a highlighting pen, not a tough screen but just to be able to highlight and note things in text.	1
	it allows you to bookmark but not note which is very important.	1
	hopefully  the next kindle will be college textbook compatible.	1
	kindle dx.i am very happy with the kindle dx.	1
	it is easy to read and use.	1
	the instructions are clear and precise.      	1
	global ver.	1
	available 2 weeks after christmas??	1
	?.the dx was #1 on my christmas list.	1
	my family bought it for me.	1
	now, two weeks after the new year, i learn that it's available in a global version??	1
	will this upgrade be available to those of us who've already purchased/received dxs?.	1
	after spending hundreds of dollars on 'convenience' reading gadgets (a ver.	1
	1, ver.2 & dx) i find myself relegated to 'paperback release' status on books w/in the us.	1
	now, adding insult to insult, my brand new dx is, w/in less than a month rendered obsolete unless i spend another $500 for the 'new, improved, global version'.	1
	this is marketing at its' most cynical and avaricious.	1
	shame on you.      	1
	good product.	1
	however, far behind its times..	1
	a nice device but....	1
	why can't i connect at home?.i love the kindle dx.	1
	it is my first kindle and i don't know how i survived without it.	1
	my only complaint is i can't connect and download in the town i live in.	1
	i have to drive 99 miles in order to connect.      	1
	this device is defective!!!	1
	!.this device is defective.	1
	amazon recently stole george orwell's 1984 and animal farm from every customer who had purchased it by remotely accessing customers devices!!!!	1
	i'm so upset about this.	1
	they had no right.	1
	if you haven't bought an e-book reader yet you might want to check into irextechnologies for drm-free e-book readers.	1
	i know for a fact that they do not control your device once you buy it- and bet yet they are based on open source.	1
	they are more costly-but at least you'll be able to finish your books.      	1
	does everything amazon says it will.	1
	can anyone tell me why the kindle version is only 10% cheaper than the hardcover.here is what i dont get about the e-book/kindle business.	1
	i was looking at 'this time is different' book.	1
	hardcover is $17, when softcover come it will be what?	1
	$8-9...how can the kindle version cost $15.30??	1
	remember that the kindle version is not ownership, you actully rent the book.lets do the math.	1
	kindle dx $489savings from hardcover $1.70number of books required to 'pay' for kindle 288 if you read 1 book per month, it will take you 24 years!!	1
	!now, if you are buying paperback... impossible.	1
	how can this make any sense? 	1
	i will not buy it until amazon opens it up.i am in the market for a larger reader and i am comparing the dx to sony's, soon to be released reader daily edition.	1
	i have decided not to buy the dx because of the way amazon tries to control content.	1
	the pdf viewer does not work with full 8 1/2 x 11 pages as they are too hard to read when the dx shrinks them down.	1
	you cannot annotate, use links or search the documents and there are no other formats supported.	1
	the dx also does not have an expansion slot.	1
	what would that have added to the cost?	1
	perhaps $5?	1
	last, but probably most important, the dx needs a folder structure.	1
	i am not sure that amazon reads these review, but stop being so greedy.	1
	open this up to most popular formats, give expansion and fully support pdf documents and you have a winner.	1
	keep you proprietary format forcing me to buy from you and you will not sell to me.	1
	listening, amazon?      	1
	swindled by kindle.don't waste your money.	1
	amazon's software allows them to cripple and delete purchased books without your permission.      	1
	too expensive and to limiting.i'm currently considering getting a reader, but the kindle is still way too expensive and limiting for my money.	1
	apple has learned their lesson on implementing strict limits on the ipod and are now relaxing them.	1
	once amazon figures this out, i may be interested.	1
	i think for now sony will get my money.      	1
	only buy this if you want to potentially lose all your books in 2 years...when you buy a kindle, amazon controls it, not you.	1
	the content is not in an open format that can be read by other products.	1
	so.. if your kindle breaks and amazon decides to stop offering it, you're out of luck and you can't use the books you've bought.	1
	if subsequent kindle versions aren't to your satisfaction, you're out of luck.	1
	lastly, they can enter into your kindle and delete your books at any time, as they did to hundreds of their customers who bought copies of 1984. don't buy an e-reader that does not support open standards and formats for e-books, and that puts big brother in control at the expense of the individual.      	1
	going to wait until this stuff 'bakes'.i have read a lot of the reviews and appreciate the input.	1
	it seems to me the dx and possibly the k2 are still just a bit 'too new' and untested to invest this amount of money.	1
	i love the concept and it seems the kindle is a reasonably nice product.	1
	however, things i have picked up from the reviews which tell me to wait for a year or two are: 1.  price.	1
	this is still a bit too expensive to feel comfortable that i am getting my money's worth.	1
	amazon should do what the ink-jet printer folks did which is give you the printer for almost nothing and you pay big on the refills -- give the kindle away for almost nothing and make the money on the downloads.	1
	this will get millions of kindles out on the market creating a lot more demand for content.	1
	2.  it appears the dx (and maybe the k2?)	1
	screen will likely break or get scratched even under fairly normal use - really bad design by amazon and the current policy is to charge you $350 to get it fixed.	1
	2. the other big issue is the battery.	1
	if i understand correctly, you cannot buy a replacement battery, you have to turn your kindle in for over $100 or more to have them ship you a new kindle (so why can't they ship you a new kindle if you screen breaks for the same price?)	1
	this means that about every two years (average time for batteries to work for a long period of time) you are paying over $100 to keep your kindle working.	1
	3. if you upgrade to the next kindle, you have a good chance of losing books you previously bought that amazon claims is 'safe forever'.	1
	4. amazon seems to believe they are the morality police and will delete whatever they feel is inappropriate on your kindle - really bad policy.	1
	5. i think having some kind of built-in led light would be useful to make it readable at night or while in a car or similar.	1
	this would be a small drain on the battery, but very useful.	1
	i think this space needs a really strong competitor to motivate amazon to 'do this right'.	1
	i don't see this taking off until there is a strong competitor and these core issues addressed.	1
	dale	1
	too much missed opportunity.so a friend of mine got one of these as an early xmas gift from a relative and brought it in, and i got to spend an afternoon playing with it.	1
	i'm a 'say it like it is' kind of guy and am known for seeing both sides to things, so i'll be my usual blunt self: in theory, it's exciting to be able to download books immediately and not have to worry about storing books everywhere.	1
	while the device itself is not necessarily 'green', over time in a side-way, you save a few trees, maybe.	1
	if anything it's certainly convenient to be able to carry a ton of books in one device.	1
	the wireless/cell connectivity is also convenient, and the 9+ inch screen size is welcome over what is a trend in too-small screens on the original model as well as competitor models.	1
	unfortunately, the dx suffers from 'first adoption issues'.	1
	honestly, it just feels sort of flimsy and certainly doesn't feel like something that could stand up to a couple of years or more of heavy use.	1
	with oled and other technologies as they are available now, the fact you cannot see color on the screen is confusing.	1
	how great it would be to be able to download time, newsweek, or national geographic magazines and be able to view their prize winning photographs as well as their articles - but you cannot with the readers - they are all black and white only.	1
	being able to view a publisher's online content and having the ability to see video clips via that route would be a welcome as well, but once again, these are not features available to buyers.	1
	you can however, buy a 'netbook' which can do pretty much all of these things, and costs around $100.00 less than the dx, which at nearly $500 is far far too overpriced for what it does.	1
	so, while the friend of mine didn't have to pay for their dx as it was a gift, i'm sure they'll find it to be a useful item to have (for free).	1
	they did admit to me however, that they would not pay nearly as much for one on their own considering the limitations.	1
	when amazon can offer a 10' screen kindle in color, made of an industrial-grade plastic, with the ability to access publisher web sites and online magazine content via web (or proprietary ways), and do so for $250 or less, then i like many others i'm sure, will head for the store with my credit card in hand.	1
	until then, sorry.	1
	neat idea - incomplete implementation.       	1
	kindle's whispernet may not work in all areas.we could not link our kindle dx to its sprint network in our area.	1
	after 4 calls to amazon technical department they concluded that the internet signal in our neighborhood (entirely residential, near 2 major freeways) was too weak to permit access to kindle's whispernet, impossible to download anything.	1
	check the sprint coverage in your area before you actually purchase the device.	1
	we were sorry to have to return it unused, actually quite disappointed.  	1
	no back lighting or color..	1
	when i can get color, i will buy one..the present kindle is like b/w television--great if nothing else is available.	1
	if phones can do color, why can't kindle?      	1
	good idea.	1
	poor execution.	1
	worse return policy.	1
	handwriting kindle.i could really use this for business, especially in meetings, if it had the capability to take hand written notes with a stylus.	1
	i would then expect to have the notes deliverable to my desktop or email.	1
	love my kindle!	1
	come on amazon make it so!      	1
	missing a big opportunity.i think the kindle is great but i think they are missing a big opportunity by not having kindle textbooks.	1
	imagine going to college and having to only care a 1 pound kindle for all your classes.	1
	it would save a lot of space and back pain.      	1
	great product but not worth $489.	1
	what, no backlight?!	1
	?.i was looking forward to receiving my kindle dx very much and was very pleased to play with it when i got it.	1
	the text is very crisp and images are superb if formatted properly.	1
	it's not overly heavy and the buttons all seem to be in the right place for your fingers.	1
	the interface is also pretty good once you get used to it.	1
	then i thought i'd check out how good it was when using the backlight.	1
	what backlight you ask?	1
	well if you do ask then you're wiser than i am because i just assumed that this would have a backlight that you could turn on for reading in the dark like the sony reader does.	1
	you see, i wanted to use it for reading in bed.	1
	i'm not a good sleeper and when i wake up in the small hours it helps to read for a bit and i can usually nod off again.	1
	i have been reading on my ipod touch and thought the kindle would be less like reading a book through letter box.	1
	but it was not to be.	1
	for the last two days i have tried to find excuses to keep it but, sexy as it is, superb as it is, it just doesn't have a backlight.	1
	so today, sadly, i returned it to amazon (5 stars for their returns policy).	1
	please can the next version have a backlight option?      	1
	impressive with room for improvement.i really like the dx as this is my first real experience with a kindle beyond some brief experiences with the k2.	1
	i live the screen and resolution/readability, a lot.	1
	however, the things it could really use are:1. a touch screen display.	1
	it would be really nice to finger through the pages like a book, or more accurately, like my iphone.	1
	it's more natural and conducive to the experience than using the little joystick (which is a bit frustrating).2. smoother transitions between pages.	1
	this is most likely a processor thing that will improve with time.3.	1
	wifi.	1
	the 3g is just not always fast.	1
	plus, will it work when i travel to canada?4.	1
	better front-end content.	1
	better organization of book recommendations, sorting, etc.5.	1
	a built-in light.	1
	yeah, call me crazy on this one, but i want back lighting not a light shining on the front.	1
	outside of that, hats off to amazon!	1
	great initial efforts and i sincerely wish them well with this and future kindle's to come.      	1
	a little disappointed.	1
	attractive, but the software is crippling.and so, without your approval, consent, or knowing, amazon can delete, un-delete, and change the content of your kindle.	1
	should a company decide what stays in my library?	1
	no.      	1
	sprint???	1
	?.why did they choose to use only one method of downloading, with a network that does not have the greatest coverage area?	1
	if you do not live in a major metropolitan area, your out of luck with this device.	1
	it would be a three hour drive for me to download a book!!	1
	hey, why not have a usb/pc download option!	1
	duh!	1
	!      	1
	trying to send it back.	1
	dx... same crap, bigger box..so, now the kindle has taken to deleting your books... talk about a device that doesn't respect your freedom.	1
	do yourself a favor, don't buy any kindle products!	1
	buy a paper book instead, or go to a library.       	1
	defective by design.1.	1
	when you buy a kindle, amazon controls it, not you.	1
	they can enter into your kindle and delete your books at any time.	1
	2. they recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission (i'm not joking, google 'amazon 1984').	1
	3. amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the 'read aloud' text to speech feature on already purchased titles.	1
	4. amazon refuses to clarify what exactly their drm system can do, or how they will or won't use it.	1
	deceptive advertising practices like this are currently being looked into by the federal trade commission.	1
	notice that there is no mention or warning of drm on the kindle page.	1
	passed on kindle for sony ereader.i had a dx on order for weeks.	1
	after having my ship date pushed back twice, and hearing about how amazon can remotely delete user's purchased content at-will, i made the decision to go with a sony prs-505 ereader.	1
	basically, i saved some money, pdf support has been great, and sony supports the epub file fomat (the de-facto standard at the moment for ebooks).	1
	i don't miss the 3g support and i am glad that my books are not subject to the restrictions found in amazon's proprietary format.	1
	i would possibly consider a future version of the kindle, but the lack of support for more 'open' formats really crimps its benefits for me.	1
	i think it's important to point out that some of the 4 or 5 star reviewers rate the kindle dx so highly to compensate for spending $500 on a sub-par device.	1
	this e-reader has a long way to go.      	1
	orwellian device.amazon has the power to delete books from your kindle--books you paid money for and that you thought you owned.	1
	on july 17, 2009, amazon used this power to delete unauthorized copies of george orwell's 'animal farm' and '1984.'	1
	there is an excellent article in slate magazine today by farhad manjoo about how this technology could be used for censorship.	1
	if amazon can delete a book it believes to be infringing copyright law, then the government can order amazon to delete a book for other reasons.	1
	don't give the government this kind of control over your bookshelf.	1
	don't order the kindle or any other device that allows a bookseller or a technology company to control what's on your digital bookshelf.	1
	too large.the kindle dx was purchased for use in an airplane cockpit.	1
	i found that the kindle dx was too big for comfortable use in the cockpit.	1
	i was using it to display the instrument approach procedures.	1
	the procedures were easily readable on the dx.	1
	the width of the kindle dx was fine, it was the length that was too big.       	1
	come to the edge, my friend.	1
	and dive in...the water is warm!.if you have the personality of the 'collector' , you enjoy the physical possession of books or if you are  still buying compact disks and spend endless hours encoding digitally  and organizing them  on your wall.	1
	if you are the obsessive compulsive type who likes to have a gigantic stack of 'new yorker' magazines sitting on your floors so that maybe, possibly , for sure .....you will  read that great article that you saved for later... 5 years ago.	1
	.....then the kindle is not for you (you know who you are).just as the ipod is a device for the consumption of music, the kindle is intended for the consumption of books, and reading material in general.so i say let go of your obsessions and try it out.	1
	i am a voracious reader and enjoy reading multiple books at the same time and i have to say that i love this device so far.	1
	of course we must acknowledge that we are dealing with version 1.2 here, so there is much room for improvement.i would say i am surprised at the limited choice of magazines and medical journals ( i am a physician), but i guess they will come.      	1
	eine neue leseerfahrung.heute habe ich den amazon kindle dx geliefert bekommen.	1
	es ist die us-version, aber mit weltweitem internetzugang.	1
	das bedeutet, da der netzstecker nicht pat (den akku also am pc laden) und das wrterbuch nur auf englisch zur verfgung steht.	1
	auerdem gibt es meines wissens berhaupt keinen deutschsprachigen buchinhalt fr das gert.ich hatte vorher noch keinen kindle und auch kein anderes lesegert.	1
	insofern war es fr mich eine ganz neue erfahrung, mit dem gert umzugehen.	1
	das wichtigste beurteilungskriterium sollte hier die lesbarkeit der textdarstellung sein.	1
	zunchst einmal bin ich froh, da ich die dx-version gekauft habe.	1
	ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, da das lesen an einem noch kleineren bildschirm viel freude macht, da man stndig umblttern mu.die schrift (elektronische tinte) ist sehr gut und auch ber lngere strecken ermdungsfrei lesbar.	1
	allerdings ist das display nicht frei von reflexen.	1
	die lesbarkeit hngt wegen der fehlenden hintergrundbeleuchtung sehr vom lichteinfall ab.	1
	sie wird tendenziell besser, wenn mehr licht einfllt (z.b.	1
	von einer schreibtischlampe).wegen der reflexe ist man geneigt, das gert schrg in der hand zu halten, wofr es aber auf dauer ein wenig zu schwer ist.	1
	eine art ausklappbarer stnder wie bei einem fotorahmen wre sehr ntzlich.man gewhnt sich schnell an das gert und will es berall mit hinnehmen.	1
	auch im bett kann man es recht bequem zum lesen einsetzen (ein groer vorteil beim lesen einer tageszeitung).beim deutschsprachigen angebot an zeitungen und zeitschriften sieht es ein wenig besser aus (f.a.z., handelsblatt, wirtschaftswoche).	1
	ich habe die f.a.z.	1
	und das time magazine abonniert.	1
	aus meiner sicht ist das zeitunglesen am kindle dx eine vollwertige alternative zur printversion.	1
	es gibt sogar einige vorteile: den geringeren platzbedarf am frstckstisch und die bessere inhaltsbersicht durch die sektionsmens.	1
	allerdings sind bei der f.a.z.	1
	keine bilder und grafiken dabei.	1
	dafr ist das abonnement billiger.viele blogger und tester vergleichen den kindle mit einem pc und monieren dann etwa, da er keinen farbbildschirm hat.	1
	diese art von kritik verkennt, da es sich um ein mehr oder weniger reines lesegert handelt.	1
	und in dieser disziplin ist es einem pc meilenweit berlegen.	1
	jeder pc-nutzer wei, da man am rechner keine lngeren texte lesen kann.	1
	wegen des bildschirmflimmerns und der hintergrundbeleuchtung ist das sehr ermdend und auerdem bietet der computer als multifunktionsgert einfach zu viele ablenlungen wie youtube oder eingehende e-mails.	1
	der kindle dx ist gerade wegen seines fokussierten funktionsumfangs fr konzentriertes lesen geeignet.	1
	selbst die werbung aus den printversionen von zeitschriften und zeitungen erscheint hier nicht.	1
	es gibt keine pop-ups keinen e-mail-alarm, etc.	1
	die ablenkungen sind auf das absolute minimum reduziert und das ist sehr wohltuend.ein nachteil sind die drm-bedingt eingeschrnkten datenaustauschmglichkeiten mit dem pc.	1
	man kann die auf dem kindle befindlichen dateien im explorer sehen und im falle von bchern auch auf dem rechner lesen (dafr gibt es von amazon eine kostenlose software).	1
	die abonnierten zeitungen / zeitschriften knnen aber nur auf dem kindle dx selbst gelesen werden.	1
	das halte ich aber nicht fr so gravierend, denn man kann die ausgaben dort speichen und auerdem besteht die mglichkeit, ganze artikel oder auszge daraus (z.b.	1
	zitate) zu 'clippen'.	1
	die inhalte landen dann in einer textdatei, die am pc weiterbearbeitet werden kann.man kann den kindle auch selber mit inhalt aus unterschiedlichen formaten fttern.	1
	pdf-datein kann man einfach auf die festplatte des kindel kopieren.	1
	ein schweres manko ist allerdings das fehlen einse sd-kartenslots (den der kleinere kindle hat).die drahtlose inhaltsbertragung auf den kindle funktioniert bei mir vllig problemlos.	1
	es waren berhaupt keine einrichtungsmanahmen notwendig, weil ich schon ein amazon-account hatte und das gert darber bestellt habe.ob die anschaffung sich fr mehr als 600 dollar einschlielich aller versandspesen lohnt, mu jeder selbst beurteilen.	1
	fr f.a.z.-leser, die ihr printabo anschlieend abbestellen, hat sich das gert recht schnell amortisiert.	1
	und das angebot an deutschsprachigen titeln wird hoffentlich bald in schwung kommen.	1
	ich nutze das gert hauptschlich um pdfs und die f.a.z.	1
	zu lesen und bin mit der anschaffung trotz kleiner nachteile sehr zufrieden.      	1
	challange.i have the first kindle.	1
	the kindle dx is heavy.	1
	i have yet to figure out how to listen to music or a book...too complicated        	1
	good but not great!.	1
	you don't own content.when you 'purchase' books you don't really own them (even though amazon says you do in tos).	1
	i hope your reader fails due to your bad policies amazon.	1
	i'll discourage everyone i know and meet.      	1
	the price of a kindle?.while ebook readers are a very attractive concept, the kindle in itself is deeply flawed by the facts that you can only purchase the books from the amazon bookstore, that the books you are purchasing there are not your property but considered parts of a service, and that the service agreement is - you guessed it - totally biased to amazon and alienating your liberties as a customers.	1
	when purchasing a kindle book, you cannot read it on another device, nor can you share it with friends, donate it or sell it.	1
	if amazon stops the kindle service for any reason, the kindle device and all purchased books will become totally useless and amazon will have no liability whatsoever as clearly stated in the kindle terms of service.	1
	and finally, amazon reserves the right to remotely delete without your consent any books you have legally purchased on the device - and did so in the past on more than one occasion.	1
	is freedom the price you want to pay for a kindle?      	1
	no mention about what your drm system can do.amazon refuses to clarify what exactly their drm system can do, or how they will or won't use it.	1
	deceptive advertising practices like this are currently being looked into by the federal trade commission.	1
	notice that there is no mention or warning of drm on the kindle page.      	1
	disappointed that this product steals from people.i'm shocked that this product actually deletes products that we pay for.	1
	i wish i could give negative stars for this, or at least zero.      	1
	dont go bigger.....k2 is better...go better!!!!!	1
	!.dont waste the money on the dx!!!!!	1
	i ordered one of each to compare.	1
	here's why i say this: 1. dx to big and 'top heavy', your wrists tire after holding it for very long [actually only about 1 minute and i am a golfer with strong wrists].	1
	2. the screen is bigger [not sure this is an advantage] but not any brighter than the kindle2.	1
	3. the larger screen seems attractive however your eyes get tired of 'tracking back and forth' accross the wide screen and you will end up narrowing the type areas, i.e.	1
	increasing the margins.	1
	they will end up being not much bigger than the k2 page image size!	1
	4. portablility of the k2 is much much better.	1
	5. the k2 has a 'next page' button on both the left and right sides.	1
	the dx only has one 'next page' button on the right.	1
	6. rotating screen gets confused and slight moves cause it to rotate.	1
	in addition, while the screen is rotated you have to 'take your hand off the side of the kindle to hit 'next page'.	1
	this might seen like no big deal but ........ if you are an avid book reader, you will still want that 'book in hand' feel and with the k2, you just press the 'next page' button located directly under your left or right thumb....... no letting go of the 'book'!	1
	7. the supposedly 'new pdf feature' is not that much different than on the k2 and in fact is something most people would use  their small notebook computer for or a blackberry.	1
	let's face it!	1
	kindle is for getting all of those books that are scattered around the house, stacked on the nightstand, desk or any other place they seem to accumulate.	1
	my husband is so thankful he lo longer trips over all of my books!did i mention that the wide range of font sizes does not require me to look for my reading glasses if i forget and leave them upstairs or wherever?	1
	best of all i like being able to switch form book to book or from book to today's newspaper [great for reading the news while you are out of town].	1
	hope this helps and you haven't already made your purchase!!	1
	!      	1
	kindel dx.for $500 i can get a fully functional computer not something that's highly limited in functionality and forces me to only buy stuff from amazon.	1
	think about it amazon management: you want to sell hardware or e-books?	1
	-- my suggestion is give the hardware away at a significant discount and make money off the e-books.	1
	i'd be more than happy to give up paper books but not if i have to part with $500 for a device with very, very limited functionality which only gets me books from one vendor.	1
	if you are going to impose these restrictions on me, i expect to get the hardware dirtcheap.	1
	is there anything that difficult to understand about this amazon management?	1
	!	1
	cost.this needs to come down in price.	1
	it is a reader, not a computer.	1
	you can get a computer that will do much more for the money and ease.	1
	i will not buy this until it has a reasonable price.	1
	i bet if it were more affordable, amazon would see an increase in sales for this and its media.      	1
	asking too much money!.kindle dx costs way too much for it having so little features.	1
	the sony psp is only $199 and it has loads of features (for gamers)!	1
	so my point is, if you are going to make a hand held device made for reading books, give it all the features it should have(for readers).	1
	if sony can do it for games, i'm sure amazon can do it for kindle!      	1
	amazon can monkey with your kindle titles.this is a product defective by design.	1
	are you aware that amazon can interfere with books you thought you had purchased and owned?	1
	ironically, hundreds of purchasers of george orwell's '1984' and 'animal farm' had these titles, which they owned, deleted from their kindles by amazon.others had the 'read aloud' function switched off for titles that they had purchased.	1
	and a student who had added notes to a book lost all his work when amazon deleted the book!unlike a real book, a kindle book has a long piece of wire all the way back to amazon, so they can jerk you around however they want.and it's overpriced.	1
	they are using the cheap razor, expensive blades paradigm, except the kindle ain't cheap.      	1
	this is very cool but has limitations..i don't like it is not back lit.	1
	i am sure there is a mechanical reason for this like heat or something....but!	1
	i don't like that you can't tell if amazon is going to cut you off with wireless.	1
	they supposedly can shut you off if you don't buy enough but i haven't seen it yet.	1
	i don't like you have to pay to get your email on the device.	1
	for the amount of the device i think you should get some email for free up to a certain amount.	1
	the pluses are my wife loves reading any where any time with multiple books.	1
	she loves going into to a meeting with a client and pull a reference immediately.	1
	it is small and efficient and a very a neat gadget.steve      	1
	orwell's books are classics.deleting books by orwell that people have purchased is extremely shady.	1
	don't buy this if you want to be able to read good books.      	1
	so i don't own my books?.the news about amazon.com's overnight removal of 1984 & animal farm from kindles is extremely disappointing.	1
	i've had my finger hovering over the buy button for the last week but there is no way i'd even consider buying a kindle without this capability completely disable without any way of re-enabling it.       	1
	high price.with today's economy the price tag is more than i can handle but would love to get one of these.	1
	i could afford kindle 2 but will hold out in hopes of some type of price reduction on kindle dx, as an older adult going back to school the pdf would be wonderful for me.	1
	i hope a lower price comes soon, as a single mom i would love to buy it but  times are too tough to justify that price for me.	1
	even with an amazon credit card (which is tempting) i guess i will wait.	1
	enjoy your kindles everyone.	1
	:-)      	1
	ripoff.this device deletes books, the book deleted was 1984, though i feel like i've fallen into amazon's very own version of farenheit 451.      	1
	issues.- very expensive- not a colour display- download it's not so speedy  i suggest to wait for a new gadget with the mentioned issues solved.      	1
	fair review.i generally like the product.	1
	however, i want to be able to move docs (kindle docs) back and forth between my computer and the kindle.	1
	i don't have the ability to use the docs on my computer - such as open and read the docs that were down loaded from kindle.	1
	this places me at a disadvantage.	1
	also, there are not enough books available as kindle.	1
	i have found several that i was looking for not to be available as a kindle doc. 	1
	awesome!!!	1
	!.quite simply awesome!!!!	1
	i can't live without it.a wonderful product.	1
	chuck      	1
	will not buy kindle dx until next-generation release (k3).i really want the kindle dx!	1
	however, i will wait until the price is reduced by $100 - $150.	1
	i think $500 is too high for an ebook reader.	1
	i could buy two netbooks for that price.	1
	also, some reviewers have expressed their disappointment in the native pdf versatility and the keyboard functionality.      	1
	too expensive & too small to read quickly.i would love to buy the kindle dx but the price is a little steep.	1
	the problem i have with the smaller kindle is that i have to enlarge the print size so it is comfortable to my old eyes and that has me changing pages frequently.	1
	perhaps the large kindle will come down in price and i'll feel comfortable spending that much.	1
	i love the concept and the price for new books.	1
	it is a real winner.      	1
	scary..i have had the kindle dx in my cart for weeks.	1
	i couldn't wait until they returned to current stock to get one without waiting.	1
	when i saw that amazon could unilaterally delete books lawfully purchased, i decided to stick to the tried-and-true, feel good paperback book.	1
	the e-book idea is terrific in many aspects, but until amazon figures out that its customers don't want to be ripped off through some computer slight-of-hand, i'll hold off buying one, just like many others.       	1
	i'll get it when it has no drm.the technology itself is great.	1
	if it weren't for the the proprietary format of the ebooks and the drm i would definitely get one.	1
	those are killer defects for me, enough to cripple all the advantages of the technology.	1
	i want to have as much control over my ebooks as i want over my paper ones.      	1
	i want to always have the books i buy.i do not want to buy books amazon or the publishers will be able to pull back from me while i am reading or when i need to read them.      	1
	background is too dark.this would be a great product, but the background is too dark.	1
	this may just be an e-ink limitation and not amazon's fault.	1
	perhaps in the future we will see a display closer to what a real book looks like - black type on a white background.	1
	right now, the contrast between the reading surface and the black type could be a lot better.	1
	as a result of this low contrast, you need more light to read the kindle.	1
	some of you may want to wait until the technology advances to show better contrast and even a color display.      	1
	amazon's use of drm.amazon's use of kindle's drm to control and monitor users and their books constitutes a clear threat to the free exchange of ideas.	1
	amazon has already removed 'read aloud' capability from books and deleted purchased copies of books on two separate occasions--all without users' permission and in apparent violation of their terms of service.	1
	they even deleted the personal notes of a high school student, taken while reading 1984. this power to control the exchange of ideas is unacceptable in a free society.	1
	amazon's assurances that it will refrain from the worst abuses of this power do not address the problem.	1
	amazon should not have this power in the first place.	1
	until they give it up they will be tempted to use it, or they could be forced to by governments or narrow private interests.	1
	whatever amazon's reasons for imposing this control may be, they are not as important as the public's freedom to use books without interference or supervision.	1
	big brother's book-loaning service.another defective piece of technology designed to 'protect' big business' 'intellectual property' and at the same time, trample on the consumer's throat.	1
	feel free to buy this hunk of junk if you want to shell out hard earned cash to rent digital 'books' that can be taken away from you with the press of a key.      	1
	almost bought dx.was just about to press buy when i read reviews about loan of books not purchase.	1
	so- i will not buy this kindle dx until amazon allows purchasers to really own the books they buy for $9.99.	1
	was this always the case?	1
	it is misleading to see purchase $9.99 when it really means rent $9.99.       	1
	why?.why can they just delete my books?	1
	why should i buy books if i don't even 'own' them...      	1
	drm infected!	1
	!.amazon can and has deleted books from peoples kindles.	1
	boycott the kindle until the they stop deleting books!      	1
	amazon and drm make this a useless buy.since amazon can reach in and delete any and all books you have legally purchased, having this is useless.      	1
	buyer beware.	1
	comparison with nook from barnes & noble.i own the ebook reader from barnes & noble which is old.i tried searching for nook to compare it with kindle, but the amazon search engine did not return any results for it.	1
	why?      	1
	loaded with drm.the kindle has all what it takes do be a great product but it also has all what it takes do be a product that you don't want to buy.	1
	this little device could have been your own portable library, it could have allowed you to carry hundreds of pounds worth of books with you all the time.	1
	however, amazon decided to load the kindle with digital restriction management (drm).	1
	you never own the books that you put on the kindle and amazon can delete them anytime they want, remotely, and without requiring your consent.	1
	not only they can, they already did; they deleted everyone's copy of 1984 by george orwell.	1
	until amazon provides a kindle without drm, i advise anyone to stay away from the kindle.      	1
	waste of money.i have palm's ereader and i like it better than the kindle.	1
	here is a picture i took showing palm's e-reader on a palm tx handheld: [...]  that picture shows that palm's ereader and the e-ink display of the kindle are not any different from each other.	1
	my palm tx handheld has 128mb of internal memory and a 2gb memory card for extra storage.	1
	i store the ereader and the ebooks on the 2gb memory card and any other apps i want on the internal memory.	1
	this way, i can store over 7800 ebooks and still have lots of room for whatever apps i want.	1
	the 2gb amazon kindle is capped at 1500 ebooks...1500 vs 7800...do the math.      	1
	fragile, with overpriced book offerings.the new kindle costs $489 and is capable of downloading any of 285,000 e-books available on amazon, via sprint nextel's high-speed data network (sorry, requires a clumsy workaround outside the u.s. for books, not at all for periodicals or newspapers).	1
	also, no protective carrying case, and it breaks easily.	1
	sounds like a lot of available books until you focus on new releases (many are not available).	1
	also it's only a black-and-white display roughly the size of a paperback, with a crippled web browser, no ability to blow-up eg.	1
	charts, no video, and not even a backlight.	1
	its content also includes newspapers, for a fee, that mostly can also be accessed for free on the internet.	1
	the 'good news' is that it can display content sideways, and handle graphic-heavy content.	1
	barclays capital predicts kindle devices will produce $840 million in profit on $3.7 billion in sales in 2012, roughly 20% of current performance.	1
	both the washington post and new york times subsidize kindle purchases, in return for long-term subscriptions to their respective newspapers.	1
	however, that is a dubious incentive given their already free availability to viewers, and the fact that kindle currently does nothing to address newspapers' steep fall in advertising revenues; changing that on kindle would be annoying, at best.	1
	amazon has recently substantially increased prices for kindle e-books - eg.	1
	'education of an american dreamer' is priced at $19.24, vs. $22.29 for the hard-cover, hardly an attractive differential.	1
	(original kindle promotions led buyers to believe most downloads would be $9.99.	1
	this price increase for downloads makes kindle dx financially untenable for casual readers; according to a 5/31/09 nyt article, amazon is losing money at that $9.99 price because it generally is charged $13-!4/copy.)	1
	further, a 7/10/09 wsj article reports amazon pricing kindle editions of legal reference books at only a 20% discount, based on the logic that its ability to provide digital search and bookmarks largely overcomes the disadvantage of not having a physical copy.	1
	another digital advantage would be the ability, for another fee, to instantly update/replace older editions.	1
	given the large potential for electronic textbooks in medicine, law, and especially the college-student market (the latter would probably also kill off the textbook resale market - another 'benefit'), it is easy to suspect that amazon is finding a new way to milk the textbook market for all its worth.	1
	on the plus side, maybe kindle will allow us to stop building expensive professional law and medical libraries, as well as to save the time and expense of traveling to/from them.	1
	one more feature - users can still deliver business documents via email to their kindles, for an increased fee, now 15 cents per megabyte, per walter mossberg at wsj.	1
	still wondering, will kindle dx users be able to re-download their existing book purchases on future versions?	1
	another recent problem is that amazon suddenly 'recalled' purchased copies of 'animal farm' - shocking and dismaying many users (their purchase price was refunded); regardless, it isn't possible to loan one's kindle edition of a book like a hard-copy - unless the kindle goes with it.	1
	bottom line: the amazon kindle dx is a one-trick pony priced too close to new portable notebooks.	1
	pricing of casual reading and textbooks offered is too high in most instances to be attractive.	1
	apple, google, dell and/or sony will likely see kindle dx as an opportunity to restore the focus on lowering book prices.	1
	google ebooks is already headed that direction - allowing its huge collection to be received by any reader       	1
	was going to buy.i had planned to buy this product within the next week, but fortunately, i thought about reading the reviews first, i was surprised to see so many one star ratings, so i decided to go through all the reviews thoroughly.	1
	there's a couple of reasons i decided not to go ahead and buy; but what really made me turn my back on it is how they are able to delete the books you already 'purchased', that is just outrageous as it is ridiculous.	1
	why would i ever want to pay $10 for the 'right' of reading the book, when i can pay $15 or $20 to own it.	1
	i think the kindle is not ready for the electronic era yet, and i will buy until the books i can permanently keep the books i buy.      	1
	-all- ebook readers are horrible....i became interested in buying an ebook reader since i read tons and tons of pdf tech manuals and books on my laptop.i thought it would be nice to be able to cuddle with a ebook reader and read my books laying back in my comfy sofa sipping green tea instead of always being seated in a 'working' posture.so i did what i always do.	1
	i started researching the dozen or so readers on the market.	1
	i was shocked to discover that none of the reader were good enough to even be a product!	1
	let alone a $500+ product.the kindle and sony seem to have a major design flaw that makes them susceptible to screen breakage.	1
	i will not even mention the inadequacy of the performance of every one of these readers when it comes to reading pdf files.so for now, i will stick to my wonderful and cheap $500 laptop and will not be dazzled by techno-toys and fantasy e-ink technology.	1
	i must admit, if you are a gadget lover like i am, it's a very sexy thing to have.	1
	i've wanted one since the first time i saw captain kirk use a e-tablet to write on so many years ago.	1
	unfortunately the technology is just not refine enough yet.	1
	it takes a lot of planning and good sound engineering along with a near-perfect ergonomics and rigorous product testing to make a fantastic product.	1
	one can't just slap a display and a processor with a few bottons and call it a reader.	1
	the problem with today's products are that the companies are all in such a rush to 'hit the market', that all their products end up being 'half-ass', and don't live up to expectations.yes they make a lot of money at the beginning, but they are short sighted greedy people.	1
	they make a bad name for themselves and anybody knows, you can't erase a 'bad name'.	1
	ask toyota or honda what they had to go through to avoid getting a bad name.	1
	i will remember the name of these companies when the time comes to buy a reader.	1
	and so should you.	1
	i too think that an apple ibook is needed to come along, and kick everyone of these bozos out of business for good.	1
	until then, long live my laptop...	1
	drm: worse than a waste of money.the problem with the kindle is its restriction on user freedom.	1
	when i 'purchase' and ebook from amazon, i do not own the book in the same way i own a physical book.	1
	i am not free to read it wherever i want (on any device i choose) nor can i give it away, share it with my friends, donate it or sell it.	1
	the user is entirely at the mercy of the distributor.      	1
	1950's sophistication.	1
	...only there are some that are more equal than the others!.imagine your (paper) books could evaporate from you home during the night if the publisher and the bookshop you bought them from decided so.	1
	that's exactly what's happened (ironically) to george orwell's kindle ebooks '1984' and 'animal farm'.	1
	no, thanks!      	1
	horrible!.they recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission (i'm not joking, google 'amazon 1984').	1
	amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the 'read aloud' text to speech feature on already purchased titles.	1
	amazon refuses to clarify what exactly their drm system can do, or how they will or won't use it.	1
	deceptive advertising practices like this are currently being looked into by the federal trade commission.	1
	notice that there is no mention or warning of drm on the kindle page.      	1
	drm.1.	1
	when you buy a kindle, amazon controls it, not you.	1
	they can enter into your kindle and delete your books at any time.	1
	2. they recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission (i'm not joking, google 'amazon 1984').	1
	3. amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the 'read aloud' text to speech feature on already purchased titles.	1

	no coverage in missoula mt.!!!	1
	!.i was so excited to get my kindle dx so that i could read .pdfs without conversion and most of all to get the ny times and washington post delivered to it directly every morning.	1
	well imagine my disappointment when i found there is no 'whispernet' coverage in missoula mt.	1
	it strikes me as funny since they are selling it as a replacement to text books,  and missoula is a university town.	1
	the university of montana is no podunk school though i dont know the actual number of matriculated students, i am sure it at least equals the colleges or universities in grand forks, north dakota where i was this weekend looking at a classic car.	1
	it worked like a charm there but when i returned to missoula...nothing!!!	1
	of course support says there is a 'slow' network in missoula but so far i haven't found the few square yards of coverage that must constitute a 'slow' network.	1
	the 'whispernet' is so quiet that my kindle cant hear it.in all fairness this is a nice little piece of tech bling but not to be able to have it work as promised is just a pain.	1
	i could download books and periodicals to my computer and then connect my kindle and drag them over but when youre sold the idea that books can be downloaded directly to you kindle no matter where you are, it makes the standard multi-step process seem dinosaur-ish to say the least.	1
	i called up(for the fourth time but this time is the last) tell to them that i want to return it because it doesnt work as promised.	1
	the operator was very nice and understood completely.	1
	ive come to realize that everything about this device, from the build quality to the customer service, is top drawer.	1
	its just that the network they tout as being everywhere simply is not everywhere.	1
	i thought it was a cellular network which missoula is blanketed with.	1
	i have no idea why the only cellular device that doesn't work in missoula is amazon's device.	1
	they really have made me angry with this thing...i wanted so bad to have this device work as advertised.well i guess ive said the same thing every way i can think of so in closing:great device, great customer service, no whispernet coverage where i live.	1
	its only one out of three but its the big one in this case.	1
	just make sure you have coverage before you buy it, and if they say you have 'slow' coverage then you most likely will have no coverage.      	1
	major problem for me....i love the idea of this.	1
	however i am stunned it does not use some type of sdhc card to store your books on.call me when it can access sdhc cards...     :/      	1
	steals already-bought products.unbelievable, not only does it make you give up the printed version, but amazon deletes your books (your, as in, you paid for) for no reason.	1
	i'd better wait for a reader that doesn't rip you off      	1
	love kindle 2.love my kindel 2. for the dx price amazon should have thrown in a night light background so you can read in bed and not bother your significant other.      	1
	amazon remotely deletes books.kindle owners were treated to a dose of doubleplus irony when amazon remotely deleted their orwell purchases.	1
	this is an interesting product, but i am going to stick to printed books for now, since no one can remotely erase their pages.	1
	if i buy a copy of something it's mine.	1
	if you 'buy' a book for a kindle, it apparently still belongs to some greedy criminal at a publishing house.	1
	don't waste your money on this thing.      	1
	looks great, but unfortunantly a waste of money.looks great, but unfortunately a waste of money due to the fact that the apple tablet is coming in january along with a plethora of other color display devices with a lot more features.	1
	so by mid january or latest the end of january these should be flying off the shelves for about 50 dollars each.	1
	i really don't see why they haven't lowered the price already.maybe more near the christmas day they will lower the prices.either way i will wait and see what the other the apple tablet, and the microsoft courier have in store for us.      	1
	breech of trust and violation of the 4th amendment.amazon's practice of removing from the kindle the documents and books they consider obtained improperly means that the company has a backdoor access to your documents on kindle.	1
	the mere existence of such access and the legal claim of amazon to the right to use it is preposterous.i am not even talking about book removal, which constitutes theft, as was rightfully noted by professor david sheppard in his review.	1
	amazon is in no position to make a decision on the legality of a book or a document ownership to begin with.	1
	this can only be done by legal authorities  within appropriate legal framework.even i, a mere scientist, know that.	1
	how come amazon lawyers don't?	1
	blinded by the same slavish desire to please your master at any cost like our legal giants mr.alberto gonzales and mr. john yoo??	1
	but dos that really serve the interests of amazon shareholders?	1
	who can guarantee that same technology cannot be used by amazon, a business concern with unknown political, religious or ideological affiliation, or by a rouge employee or just an external hacker to search, obtain and sell or use for improper or even dangerous purposes private notes, scientific or engineering ideas, patent applications, proposals that an owner of  kindle can have on his or her device?	1
	creating a possibility of such an access is a clear danger to privacy rights, violation of the 4th amendment and a danger to business and even  national security.	1
	what about identity theft?how can an investor in amzn stock cannot be horrified to his or her core of such a possibility and gargantuan legal and financial problems the company is created for itself by legally claiming a right to such backdoor searches of private written of imaging materials?	1
	what law school the lawyer who approved that idiocy went to?	1
	who was his/her business law professor?	1
	where was the amazon board?	1
	what happen to mr. bezos's business instincts that served him so well in the past? 	1
	no digital restrictions management!.i don't want amazon to control, which books i read.	1
	i don't want amazon to change or delete my library.	1
	i don't want to pay the price of a book for the mere right to read an ebook.	1
	i don't want to pay for my right to read at all.	1
	i want to own the books i paid for.	1
	i want to read the books i paid for wherever i want, to whomever i want, whenever i want.	1
	and i don't want amazon or anybody else to watch me read their books, unless i invite them to.	1
	i want to read ebooks.	1
	but i don't want kindle, because what amazon and the industry calls 'digital rights management' in fact is a 'digital usage control'.	1
	and i don't want to be controlled.	1
	i want the freedom of read, as much as i want the freedom of thought and the freedom of speech. 	1
	no thanks.i was impressed with the reviews of the kindle & was looking to buy one.	1
	now i find that amazon don't let me own the books i buy and can withdraw them at any time they decide.	1
	i can't look at an old newspaper that i've bought and paid for?	1
	no thanks.      	1
	a note from a kindle fan..first how can you review an item that is not available?	1
	it will be delivered tomorrow 6/11.	1
	second the external storage (sd card) went away with the k2 get over it.	1
	the dx can store up to 3,500 books and documents.	1
	how many people do you know that carry that much information with them wherever they go?	1
	to me the review first review given by 'm.	1
	kim' is the same as saying that i canceled the order for my ipod because it only has internal storage.	1
	if you looking for external storage do the same thing that you would with an ipod and copy your files to your computer or an external hard drive.	1
	there is an option to download you books and files to your computer.	1
	i have had the kindle1 which i sold so that i could purchase a kindle2; which i also sold so that i can get the dx.	1
	i have not had an issue with the k1 or k2 and with over 600 books on my reading list i have not come close to using up the internal storage that is provided.	1
	as you can tell by now i am a kindle fan; this device brought me back to reading for pleasure for which i am grateful. 	1
	kindle dx wireless reading device (9.7' display, u.s. wireless, latest generation).	1
	drm problem not solved yet.i seriously thought about buying a device like this - until i read about amazon's restrictive drm.	1
	it is critical enough, that they can delete files from the kindle, but what if they fail?	1
	will all the books i bought at amazon go down the drain?	1
	no, amazon, think about your drm again!	1
	until then i will enjoy printed books.       	1
	no reading in the dark..	1
	cannot buy and own books for kindle.amazon recently erased books from the kindle.	1
	they erased '1984' and 'animal farm' by george orwell (if you do not believe me, google for 'amazon 1984'.).	1
	they can do this because they control the kindle, not the user.	1
	this will not happen if you buy traditional books.	1
	no one can enter your home and take them from you.	1
	amazon also removes features of the kindle without the consent of the user.	1
	they recently removed the text to speech feature ('read aloud') for some books, not because of technical difficulties, but because they were asked to do this by publishers.	1
	again, they have that power because of drm (digital restrictions management) that gives them control over the kindle, not the user.	1
	furthermore, amazon banned a user for returning too many products and in consequence, the customer lost access to all the books they thought they owned.	1
	a traditional book would still be accessible.	1
	amazon does not state what exactly they can do to the kindle through their drm.	1
	similar practices of deceptive advertising are currently examined by the federal trade commission.      	1
	where is the color?.i have two kids.	1
	i have a mountain of books for said kids.	1
	if i could store all those books on one little, bitty device, how wonderful would that be.	1
	but what kid wants to read a book with black and white pictures?	1
	come on!	1
	this is the third device they've come out with.	1
	when are you going to add color?      	1
	concerns.i have heard from defective by design that amazon can delete any of your content with out your permission.	1
	i will buy something that i can control the content and not some third party.      	1
	to the people complaining about the lack of color.the lack of color screens is not because of amazon's sadistic desires to deny you wonderful color; it is because of the limitations of e-ink technology.	1
	this is not a regular lcd screen, but an immature technology which will take some time to get cheaper and be available in color.	1
	those of us who can't read books unless they have color need to wait a few more years at least.	1
	i know it sucks.      	1
	big mistake.	1
	question about the kindle dx.has anyone used the kindle dx as text for delivering a speech?	1
	if so, how does it work?	1
	what are the pros and cons?	1
	it seems to me that this would be much cleaner than having papers and notes.	1
	does the page turn reliably?	1
	thx      	1
	not worth the money.the price is just out of context with the abilities of the dx.    	1
	it costs more than a netbook.pros: holds a lot of ebooks, just like an 8gb usb flash/sd card cons: expensive.	1
	it costs about $100 more than an eeepc netbook with a similarly sized screen, but really do much of anything other than act as a poor facsimile of a stack of paper.	1
	gigantic.	1
	again, it's about the same size as that eeepc, which is great if you hate having to read things one line at a time like on the iphone, but also means that you won't be tucking it into a pocket or a handbag, and while i'm sure they've got overpriced cases for this behemoth, at the price point they're asking, it probably won't be leaving the house.	1
	complicated.	1
	again, the netbook wins out as when you download ebooks to an hdd, you own them.	1
	here, however, you're entering into an agreement with amazon that basically allows them to wirelessly delete data from your device should amazon's licensing terms deem it necessary, forcing you to re-purchase titles, if they are even still available.	1
	if the price was such that the hardware acted more like a library card and the majority of profit was made through sales of legitimately worthwhile downloads that i could own and hold on to, i would be more than willing to pay $100-150 for either this device or its smaller $280 counterpart, but at $280-$500 just to sit at the table, i'm staying with the library for casual pick-ups, and the book store for books that i absolutely can't live without having on my shelf or my hard drives.	1
	after all, that initial investment of $500 buys a lot of books, electronic or otherwise.       	1
	a review of an item i can not use.	1
	why now college discount!!	1
	!.is the college market not a prime target for this gizmo?	1
	if amazon doesn't cut the price soon to get some market saturation someone else is going to (read: apple, microsoft, etc).	1
	$500 is way out of most college students budget.      	1
	defective by design, kindle swindle, 1984.this product is: 'defectivebydesign', 'kindle swindle', '1984'.	1
	it is unacceptable to sell people data and to then delete that data from their device.	1
	the hardware, and software should give the purchaser freedom and rights:1) the freedom to use the hardware and software however they choose.2) the freedom to study the hardware and software to see how it works (access to the programming source code and source code for hardware drivers needed to operate the hardware is a prerequisite for this).3) the freedom to modify the source code to make the hardware and programs suit the end user's purposes and needs.4) the freedom to share the original or modified source code with others to help one's neighbors.	1
	the kindle is a defective by design swindle - it does not grant the end user these rights and freedoms.	1
	e.g., search google for '1984' and 'kindle swindle.'	1
	[...] if you think technology like this may be useful to you, then support developers who have a different design and philosophy.	1
	join the free software foundation [...] and donate your money to free (as in freedom) software projects instead of wasting it on this device and any of the 'content' that you will never own because of drm (digital restrictions management - defective by design - programming).      	1
	no new musical scores on kindle.where are the musical scores?	1
	amazon get with it.	1
	freehands is unsearchable and just old.	1
	have you heard of broadway?      	1
	where's the 'fail' star?.inconceivable that amazon has the audacity to sneak into their customer's houses and violate our privacy---without a court order or even so much as a warning.      	1
	kindle dx too expensive too soon.both kindles are a bit pricey for what they offer.	1
	limited functions.	1
	i'll wait until they have a backlight for one.	1
	if i have to turn an extra light on to read i'd rather just open a book.	1
	and no color?	1
	come on, in the world of iphones and ipods the kindle is a bit lagging with 16 shades of gray.	1
	it's kind of a step backwards.	1
	once they have those two options plus better functions i'll consider it.	1
	based on it's design there's room for other expansions, more memory, mp3 capability, video playback.	1
	the kindle should adopt what the ipod has already done: a music player that can do more than its primary function.	1
	32 gigabyte flash drives are becoming cheaper by the month, which would provide the necessary space for music, movies and games.	1
	i'm surprised amazon hasn't already planned that into the kindle 2. i'll be waiting for more features before i throw 300 to 500 dollars for something i can do on my laptop.      	1
	bad practice.i will never buy a kindle as long as amazon has the capability of deleting a book from it.	1
	this is absolutely unacceptable.	1
	shame on you amazon.      	1
	decided not to buy kindle dx.after reading the reviews about the kindle dx, i decided not buy it and to keep my sony e-reader.	1
	i wanted the larger screen, but when i read about the lack of customer service, warranty, cracking due to the cover (which i had planned to buy), cracking due to dropping, i decided that the cost did not justify moving from the sony e-reader to kindle.	1
	too bad -- i really liked the features, but it is too expensive to replace.      	1
	i like owning the things i buy.if you can't resell it, lend it to friends, make partial copies for reference, or just quote accuracy, do you really own it?	1
	if you can't even do the things that usually constitute 'fair use' under the 1976 copyright act, like personal backups, parody, transformation, or reprinting in a scholarly analysis, what good is it?	1
	when you 'buy' an e-book for your kindle, you don't get anything for it.	1
	what you have is a rental -- a temporary lease at best.	1
	somebody else claims ownership on the content you think you are holding, and can revoke it on a whim.	1
	can you even leave it to your kids when you die?	1
	in 2009, when you buy an anti-coercion diatribe like '1984', just to have it stolen back with your change left behind in its place, do you really 'own' anything anymore?	1
	what kind of world do you want to live in -- do you wish '1984' were really your life?	1
	is it your infosec, or their ingsoc -- which is it?      	1
	nineteen eighty four.due to the 1984 incident, i have decided that a device that can take back your purchases is not worth purchasing.	1
	i may do heavy business with amazon, but i will not be doing so through kindles for the foreseeable future.      	1
	ironic.	1
	i don't own a kindle .	1
	i'm considering buying one but i have to say that of all the books to be secretly/remotely removed from the device i find it humorous that 1984 is one of them lol.	1
	the fact that books that you paid for can be removed from your device remotely and without your consent , quite frankly worries me .	1
	you buy a real book its yours to keep forever and read as many times as you like .	1
	what's going to happen if they ever start to provide reference books thru kindle ?	1
	one day you'll go to reference something and the book will be gone ?	1
	i'm going to have to seriously think this purchaee over.	1
	i read a lot .      	1
	warranty issues &  class action law suit.four weeks ago i purchased kindle that works better then anyone has a right to expect.	1
	but also knew i needed an extended warranty because amazon will not always backup their warranty.	1
	the extended warranty has yet to arrive, even thought the initial promised shipping date was before the kindle was due to ship, and now i don't think the warranty ever will arrive.	1
	apparently the cracking problem is related to the cover/case that because of its design causes the kindle to crack if its not used exactly carefully.	1
	i received the cover without any instructions at all and had i not known about the cracking issue amazon would have already asked me for $180 for its repair because i surely would have cracked it.      	1
	i could rate it if i had it!.	1
	thanks for the warning!.i was very close to purchasing this product, but then i read the reviews and looked into the details of the technology.	1
	this product is scam.	1
	you're not buying any books--you are licensing them for as long as amazon feels you should be able to see the copies--and only via this product and through their 3g network.	1
	if they decide to stop providing such a service you have no way of backing up, storing, and accessing you purchases locally (on your computer, thumb drive, etc.)	1
	if you want to use it for other formats, html, doc, text, etc.	1
	beware!	1
	amazon is going to charge you fees to 'convert' and upload them.	1
	those costs can change at any moment and make your kindle worthless if you're not willing to continue paying.	1
	this was a great idea, very poorly executed.	1
	stay away from this snake oil. 	1
	real books vs kindle books.really?	1
	what's the point in getting this?	1
	if the books you get on here are just as much money or more as buying the real books why go though the trouble?	1
	it's a wast of time and money in my opinion if the the books you get on here aren't cheaper then the real books you can buy.      	1
	i caved!.okay, i did it.	1
	i have never owned an ereader before, but i will receive my dx on the 25th.	1
	i am a nursing student and i am hoping that this thing will be as helpful as they claim.	1
	does anyone know if the 'internet' through sprint will work in north central arkansas?	1
	the link to the coverage area claims it will, but if you have a sprint cell phone it will not work here.	1
	this would be a deal breaker for me, since this is one of the main reasons i chose the dx instead of the sony.	1
	i have read many reviews and noticed that the person in missoula can't get the internet.	1
	this concerns me.	1
	i am very exited about this ereader.	1
	i am not tech savy, but maybe it won't be too difficult to navigate.	1
	i would appreciate any tips from savy users.	1
	my email is gaylekruse@yahoo.com.      	1
	a bigger kindle... what more do you need?.	1
	note to amazon.i love my first generation kindle and was thinking about the kindle dx for professional use and so checked out the reviews.	1
	but i have decided to not buy one now.	1
	it seems far too risky given the reports of fragility and bad product support.	1
	i am especially disappointed to hear of such poor customer service.      	1
	is this price/functionality serious?.i have carefully reviewed all the 'specs' of the kindle dx (here on the amazon site)--along with a couple of hundred really scary reviews concerning product quality and customer support--and i confess that just i don't get it.	1
	the price of this device is $489, and all it does is display book text in grayscale?	1
	um, no color at all?	1
	does it have any productivity apps built in or available for purchase?	1
	how about games?	1
	does it play music?	1
	can you watch movies on it?	1
	is e-mail possible?	1
	what's up with surfing the web?	1
	can i do a presentation at a business meeting with it?	1
	no?	1
	no??	1
	no?????	1
	um, please pardon my naivete in this arena, but why on earth would i buy this device when the new apple ipad does almost everything for only $10 more (not to mention having four times the memory/storage capability in the least expensive model)?	1
	make no mistake:  i love amazon.	1
	i buy almost all of my tech devices here .	1
	.	1
	.	1
	but unless i'm missing something that's obvious to others, the kindle dx seems like a complete and utter waste of money today  am i wrong?      	1
	broken by design.this device is currently broken by design as demonstrated by the removal of legitimately purchased books from the amazon store by users.	1
	until this device is revised to remove drm from it and prevent the theft of content from users who have legitimately purchased said content i highly recommend against the purchase of this device.      	1
	drm = bad.if someone from amazon came into my house in the middle of the night and took all of my george orwell books i would be furious.	1
	this exact thing happened to kindle users when amazon flipped a switch and told the kindles to delete orwell.      	1
	ummm... ummm... hmm....................all though my review pretty much summed it up, i'd like to elaborate a little: 1) $489.00?	1
	seriously?	1
	where's the color screen or ability to look at magazines in brilliant, vibrant color?	1
	where's the multimedia player for my music and videos?	1
	really now, for near $500 i'd like to be able to see my favorite national geographic magazines or graphic novels.	1
	2) $10 a book?	1
	what a joke!	1
	first it's $489.00 (don't forget tax, people!	1
	), now $10 a book?	1
	here's a little math.	1
	the kindle dx can hold '3500' books, documents, periodicals, etc.	1
	who in their right mind would actually fill this thing?	1
	3500x10 = $35,000 or a new mercedes benz e-class sedan.	1
	and again, include your city's sales tax (if applicable).	1
	3) paper thin... good thing?	1
	yes, ipods and iphones aren't prone to snapping.	1
	but this is much larger, imagine if there was too much weight on one side?	1
	crack down the screen, plasma all over the place, not cool!	1
	4) given the likely possibility that some klutz is going to break theirs, for the love of whatever religious figure or belief you follow, you can get cheaper warranties for laptops these days!	1
	$109 for a 2 year extended warranty?!	1
	this guy comes with a 1 year warranty.	1
	3 years should be the warranty (included in the price of $500), if it's such a good product.	1
	5) yes, yes, you can travel with it.	1
	read at the coffee shop, or the bus stop.	1
	here's the problem with these two scenarios...       the coffee shop: people wont stop bugging you about the awkward metal plank in your hand until they see that it's a kindle dx (what's dx anyhow, deluxe?)	1
	the bus stop: if it's sunny, don't be holding that thing up, it'll blind drivers passing by and cause a 10 car pile up, resulting in 9 injured and 5 dead and $148k or private and public property damage.	1
	you really wanna go on living knowing you were the one responsible for that?	1
	6) since when do you need all those books at your fingertips?	1
	i thought that the point of a book was to read it 1 time, retain the story for a few years, and re-read it if you desire.	1
	will this product last that long?	1
	so, this is my conclusion.	1
	conclusion: if you absolutely love to read the twilight series or death note over and over and over again, non-stop, this is the product for you.otherwise, take your favorite book, place it in your bag, purse, car, tackle box, whatever.	1
	and simple read through, put back on the shelf, and read another.bonus advice!!!	1
	you guys are lucky for this, so listen up.	1
	you can find plenty of good books at outstanding prices at used book stores if you desire to keep the book.	1
	other option (more rushed if you're a slow reader), public library!!!!!!	1
	! 	1
	no digital restrictions management for me.i will not buy a kindle until all of the digital restrictions management is removed.      	1
	something very important is missong.i do not know if the kindle has an application to write notes on the side of the page.	1
	if you are gonna read for enjoyment kindle is fine, but if you are doing some research or a deep reading it is important to highlight stuff and take some notes.	1
	does this kindle give you the chance to do that?	1
	if not, i think it is still very limited.          	1
	deja vu george orwell?.orwell would be rolling in his grave if he were to see what has befallen his prize work, which, by the way, predicted this exact same circumstance.	1
	think 'big brother' is fiction?	1
	ask current kindle users what's happened to their copies of the masterpiece.	1
	they'll tell you that the amazon corporate snake slithered in under the cover of darkness and stole their property - actually deleted the material that the customers had bought and paid for!!	1
	remarkable!	1
	unbelievable!	1
	why?	1
	because they can, and we let them.	1
	time for that to stop, and i mean now!	1
	say 'no!'	1
	to this orewellian drm anti-liberty communistic b.s.!	1
	don't buy any of it.	1
	if you already have, accept the loss and destroy it.	1
	consider it a down-payment on buying back our freedom.	1
	enough already!	1
	sheesh.      	1
	not worth it.it is not worth the price it has been mentioned.	1
	i mean amazon should be subsidizing the product as people who would be this, would be buying books & other subscriptions from amazon.	1
	who in his right mind would shell 500 $ ( avg book cost : 20 $ so you can buy 20 books in the cost of this ).   	1
	not for lefties.i own a kindle 2 and love it.	1
	so, when the dx came out i was immediately interested.	1
	however, i will not buy it for one simple fact--it is not made for left-handed people.	1
	the page control buttons on the left hand side of my kindle 2--which i use constantly--have been entirely eliminated on the dx.	1
	all controls are now on the right hand side.	1
	i'd like to hear what the majority of right-handers would say if you moved all the controls to the left hand side.	1
	get my point?      	1
	i was ready to buy, but ........i was ready to buy the dx but have two significant reservations.	1
	i am an engineer by trade and i buy things either as tools or toys (sometimes a bit of both - it can be hard to distinguish sometimes).	1
	anyway, i was intending to buy the dx both for general reading (my wife and i are running out of room for the 5000+ books we have acquired).	1
	for this purpose the kindle seems perfect.	1
	the other purpose was portable access to pdf files.	1
	for this purpose the dx's reported lack of support for table of contents is poor at best.	1
	the second issue is the reported lack of an grouping method for the items stored on the dx (folders or other methods).	1
	the storage is not a major concern as a 100 page pdf manual w/illustrations takes about 5mb.	1
	that means for a mix of kindle books and pdf technical books, 150 pdf technical books (300 pages average) and 1000 pocket books could comfortably reside on the kindle dx (with 200+ mb margin).	1
	all in all i will wait a bit longer to get it.	1
	if they fix the two issues i have, i will purchase one immediately.      	1
	drm issues.my friend bought this device and quickly learned of its drm problems.	1
	amazon acknowledges the issue and will hopefully fix it.	1
	wait till they do to buy a swindle, i mean kindle.      	1
	the kindle and its angry master.yo will never own the data inside your kindle.	1
	and you will never own the kindle either.	1
	the kindle, even when in your hands, obeys orders from amazon and amazon only.	1
	they remotely decide what the kindle will do.	1
	amazon has already censored books for instance; one morning people awoke to find out that amazon had sneaked into their homes and into their virtual libraries and deleted some books, among them orwell's 1984 for added significance.	1
	the technology behind all this is called drm, and you should never buy any product infected by it.	1
	if the kindle cannot for any reason contact its master, for instance because the product is dropped from production, it will become unusable.	1
	this has happened to many drm-laden products before, and the kindle license agreement (to which you have to agree to start using the product) says you have to swallow it; you simply loose all the books you ever 'purchased'.	1
	the only buyers of drm-infected devices are the ignorant; people who know what the technology does would never buy them.	1
	[...] [...]  edit:this text was censored by amazon from my review: please see:slate (dot) com/id/2223214defectivebydesign (dot) org/amazon1984 and please do not buy this defective and treacherous product.	1
	if you unfortunately have already, just stop using it.	1
	bozeman.my kindle 2 works very well indeed in bozeman mt.	1
	the dx will not.	1
	customer support tried heroically to get er done.	1
	alas it was not meant to be so.	1
	the unit itself seems quite acceptable in all respects,except that it does not work as intended.      	1
	seems like apple tablet will eat kindle for breakfast !	1
	!.watchout apple is into ebook reader and it may make kindle thing of the past..   i will wait to see what apple has to offer, knowing what they did on iphones, wait is worth.	1
	[...] 	1
	wibni......this is definitely a device of next generation.	1
	there are several good factors like its size, capacity and easiness of handling.	1
	the features that i would like to have so that i buy this device are1) ability to add my own memory card.	1
	sd or micro sd with support upto at least 128 gb.2) full hd 1920 x 1080 64 bit full color spectrum.	1
	i cannot imagine reading a book in just black and white.	1
	what age does this device belongs too without a color screen?	1
	a big shortcoming in my opinion3) full touch screen operations.4) wifi and blue tooth connectivity.5) ability to connect to a hdtv using hdmi or some other connectivity.	1
	i would like to read the book on big screen if i have one at my disposal.	1
	the next set of features can be incorporated in subsequent generation.	1
	but the top 5 are must-have in next release.	1
	6) support for office tools like ms word/ powerpoint to create my own notes/presentations/papers on the fly while reading.	1
	this will be a great feature for professionals, professors, phd students and even for executives.7) email and im capability.	1
	i do not want go to my laptop just to check emails if i really want to finish reading something important.	1
	communication is important even in solitudes these days and i should be able to communicate with such a device too.8) then why not have a 5mp camera to capture something i like on-the-go and annotate to something i am reading or add it to document i may be created while reading.	1
	hopefully i would see some of the above features soon so that i can get this gadget in my collection.	1
	update:10/22/2009here comes 'nook'.	1
	a true competitor... at the least it will drive down the prices and make them sensible !	1
	!      	1
	drop the drm.the kindle's drm and obtuse file management are deal breakers for an otherwise intriguing device.      	1
	color.almost $500 & no color.	1
	black & white only ( excuse me 16 shades of grey)  no thanks      	1
	apple ipad is way better alternative.for the same price apple ipad is way better alternative 1.)	1
	does email, internet, video, games, photos, web.2.)	1
	does the standard book reading3.)	1
	in color4.)	1
	looks much beautiful5.)	1
	works on wifi and books/content delivered over wifi.	1
	the only limitation with ipad is the amazon whispernet is free whereas you would need wifi for the apple ipad.      	1
	forget kindle, get the ipad.the new ipad from apple is way better then kindle.	1
	its an actual computer with a ten times better screen then kindle.	1
	the screen is led,so its super bright and a great battery saver.	1
	sunlight is no problem, so why waste money on dull device like the kindle.	1
	wait for the ipad and get a device that fully supports all pdf format, even the ones that have a large file size.	1
	the ipad is just slightly more expensive then the kindle, but the features it offer are obviously 10000000000x better.	1
	forget the kindle and get the ipad.      	1
	what gives?	1
	!.i haven't received my dx yet, but when i do i will enjoy it for what it is.	1
	i keep reading the reviews and what i don't understand is why some people keep knocking the dx for what it isn't.	1
	it isn't a microwave, a television, or anything else that isn't listed in the description.	1
	so, to get on here and complain because it's not color, the price is too high, or a myriad of other things just blows my mind.	1
	did you not read the description before making your purchase?	1
	one thing to keep in mind though if price is a concern; if you are an avid reader (and purchaser of books), then the lower cost of the ebooks will soon pay for the dx in less than a year...at least in my case it will.	1
	eventually, as technology progresses you will have your color screens, lower prices, and who knows, you may also be able to heat lunch up in it as you read.	1
	but for now, all you 'glass half empty' people, enjoy your new toy for what it is and be glad you aren't reading your books on the wall of a cave!!	1
	!      	1
	kindle dx in a sauna?.when finished exercising i continue reading in the sauna.	1
	will the kindle dx function in a sauna for about 15 minutes each day?	1
	thank you.      	1
	unnecessary gadget.pros:-light weight-you can carry all your books in this one cute thing wherever u go and read it anywhere under the sun.	1
	cons:- this is black and white.	1
	i would like it to show some color (background font, and pictures).	1
	c'mon what age are we living in.	1
	even a five dollar children's lcd pocket games come in color.- i don't need all my books all the time with me.	1
	i just read one at a time.	1
	unless i am doing a research and want to carry it with me all time for quick reference.	1
	i guess my laptop would do more than that for me.-cost...i can buy a netbook or a low end notebook for that matter.	1
	and i can do a lot of other things on it.- i am tired of carrying/adding yet another gadget to my bag.	1
	i have more gadgets than hours in a day and real need for it.- books dont go out of charge, this one needs to be charged often!	1
	burden.	1
	i have to charge my laptop, mobile phone, camera and now this one!	1
	my verdict is simple, it might be a great reader, probably the best of the readers.	1
	but personally i feel its of no big revolution, it is simply a luxury or another gadget in the shelf.i will never buy it.	1
	(this is more of review on the utility of the item than the product's characteristics.)	1
	color?	1
	?.very cool device, but at least real print materials can be in color.	1
	for [...] bucks (with no books included) one would think that amazon could make the new kindle color-capable.	1
	instead, it comes in glorious 16-shade greyscale.	1
	no thanks.      	1
	ha!.if amazon expects early adopters of new tech to go for this, when we just got royally screwed...by amazon, re the price of our kindles...it ain't gonna happen.	1
	thinking barnes and nobles' new reader just might have something.	1
	or what it doesn't have - the history of discount pricing!      	1
	solar generated mechanisam for kindle.does kindle has a solar generated mechanism so there is no need to recharge all the time?	1
	it will not only save papers but also energy in the long run.  	1
	considering....i am considering a device such as this.	1
	after reading the various reviews, it seems that folk who like to read books love this product for that purpose.	1
	folk who might see a broader use, like researching or other uses, rate the product with fewer stars.	1
	as i read these reviews, i have a clearer sense of how i would use this device.	1
	so i thank you all for your comments.	1
	i will keep watching the development of this product to see if it develops to the level of device i'd actually use.	1
	dont get me wrong, i love to read books for the pleasure of the stories.	1
	but, i also have a need to use resource materials and documents that i refer to in my line of work.	1
	perhaps, i'll be inclined to purchase such device in the near future.	1
	(if i missed this is the fine print...i'd suggest amazon put its mind with apple's and see what comes.)	1
	ps - the selection of books available are pretty much mainstream, i have not seen many book that i would be interested in purchasing.	1
	the genre of books i look for are native american, historical legal. 	1
	want it.hi.	1
	i have now owned the kindle and kindle2.	1
	love them both and wish i wasn't so impatient 'gotta have it' so that i could wait for the new and improved.	1
	when do you suppose a reading light will be built in??	1
	?      	1
	please, do not buy this item.you have to know this before taking this item:1. when you buy a kindle, amazon controls it, not you.	1
	they can enter into your kindle and delete your books at any time.	1
	2. they recently deleted hundreds of readers' copies of 1984 without their permission (i'm not joking, google 'amazon 1984').	1
	3. amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the 'read aloud' text to speech feature on already purchased titles.	1
	4. amazon refuses to clarify what exactly their drm system can do, or how they will or won't use it.	1
	deceptive advertising practices like this are currently being looked into by the federal trade commission.	1
	notice that there is no mention or warning of drm on the kindle page.      	1
	hell no!.there is no way i would buy the kindle dx or any other kindle!	1
	amazon has cut corners all over the place in designing these units.	1
	they've compromised the functionality of the kindles with their drm protections and lack of full pdf-functionality.	1
	and they're fleecing loyal amazon customers by overcharging for digital content that doesn't cost much to deliver and should be priced lower.	1
	add to that the fact that amazon failed to incorporate a backlight in the new dx, it has no memory card slots, it is poorly-ergonomically designed, and there is no international-wireless version, and it is simply a non-starter.	1
	the e-book industry is just beginning to emerge.	1
	amazon is making a disastrous mistake by trying to strong-arm us customers into having to buy and use all our content through amazon and shutting us out from using our pre-owned pdf and other format media.	1
	google is probably going to make an open-source e-book reader that is easy for developers to make applications for and the amazon kindle is going to go the way of the sony betamax; except in this instance, the kindle is in fact not the best product--far from it.	1
	amazon deserves to lose the e-book war because it is being greedy, stupid, and truculent.	1
	i would hate to see google or apple conquer yet another new technology frontier, yet it appears that is what's going to happen.	1
	i can only hope that either microsoft, sony, the other japanese electronic companies or some startup comes out with the right e-book solution with all the features we want.	1
	it should be wireless, internationally-functional (with the same prices for everyone everywhere!	1
	), backlit, accept memory cards, be ergonomic and attractive, waterproof, easily cleanable, durable and fairly unbreakable, come in 8 1/2 x 11 or compact screen sizes, accept standard battery sizes so you can choose between recharegeable or disposeable batteries (let the free market decide!	1
	), it should be able to download pay content (books, papers, magazines, blogs) from different merchants (amazon, b&n;, etc., wherever,...) plus free content from anywhere, have full pdf-functionality, have all e-book format-compatibility, a comfortable keyboard, a comfortable joystick, protective covers available in leather, vinyl, and cloth, a wide range of font sizes for people who need large-format print, full text-to-speech capability, a good file system for categorizing documents/articles/titles, a good multi-feature search function, ability to share text/articles/books wirelessly between multiple units within 20 feet, ability to use it continuously while on an airplane, a built-in full-function web browser, wikipedia access, dictionary, simple email functionality to forward articles/quotes/links, permanent lifetime title data backup even if you switch reader brands, and a sleep function that turns it off if you fall asleep reading.	1
	of course i am also waiting for them to develop color e-ink so we can have access to all textbooks ever published, but i realize they're still working on that.	1
	once google books is greenlighted and other digital book libraries are also formed, imagine getting access to every book and every article and scholarly paper ever published in history on your e-book reader!	1
	that's the future, and it will happen.	1
	but amazon has simply failed with the kindle.	1
	they have succeeded in trailblazing a new industry but absolutely and horrendously failed in implementing it.	1
	i am waiting for the company with the vision to do the e-reader the right way while not gouging their customers at the same time.	1
	for now i am sticking with my $399 laptop pc that can do everything and anything i need.	1
	in fact i might always stick with a laptop and forget about e-readers.	1
	but i will probably buy an e-reader in a few years when a company comes out with a version that has additional features, however i am really waiting for the e-reader that has everything i have just described for you above.	1
	that will take about five to ten years in my estimation, when the e-book industry will begin to approach its teen age years.	1
	right now, the e-book industry is only in its infancy, and boy does it show.      	1
	waiting....i am thinking about buying one for some time.now i've made the choice and waiting for asus e-reader.      	1
	millennium fahrenheit.wow!	1
	yet another geekoid device to further distance ones self from social interaction.	1
	no need to go to the book store, library or news stand.	1
	huddle in yet another cubicle of self induced isolation, paranoia and human disconnection.	1
	in addition, any individual who often uses the ubiquitous noun 'love' to quantify their use of an inanimate electronic device is in need of therapy.	1
	btw, sony now has two new readers that out-spec the newest-g kindle.	1
	however, the socio-opine applies to any such device.       	1
	warning: consider drm hassles before you buy a kindle.personally i think that the kindle is the greatest thing since sliced bread but, i ran across this blog today that has given me second thoughts about purchasing the product.	1
	i am posting this review to bring some attention to drm issues with amazon's kindle service.	1
	[edit] it looks like the link i posted was deleted from my review.	1
	the reason for my posting was because i read an article written by a long time kindle user called:  'kindle's drm rears its ugly head... and it is ugly'.	1
	and 'some e-books are more equal than others'  ...a short ny times news story that demonstrates that you don't actually own kindle content.	1
	google is your friend.	1
	it looks like amazon is trying to address the issue but it still needs a written policy clarification.	1
	[/edit]      	1
	kindle vs ipad.who is willing to pay $489 for kindle dx when ipad just arrived for $499?       	1
	check drm problems.i will not buy or recommend anyone else buy one of these because of the drm problems.	1
	if you do not know about drm....suggest you read up and understand what you are in for.	1
	in most cases you do not 'own' your book, or have unlimited download capability.	1
	really need to check this out before you purchase.      	1
	won't buy now!.i was getting ready to buy one but after reading the reviews i won't.	1
	when a company (amazon) won't stand behind a product they sell and have no regard for the customer i move on.	1
	with all the new e readers coming on board each day, like the new sony.	1
	some you will even be able to down load books from your local library.	1
	the new one will use at & t instead of sprint!!!	1
	everyone will be able to use the wireless feature.	1
	sprint is limited in their coverage area.	1
	so move on folks to another venue.      	1
	too many bad reviews.well, i am glad i read the reviews.	1
	too many bad reviews.	1
	not going to waste my money.	1
	and the response from amazon to some of the complaints?	1
	they may lose me as a customer and i didn't even buy a kindle.       	1
	please ship to india as well....why are you shipping only within usa?	1
	please permit shipping to india as well...i have been waiting for a year for this to happen but yet you are to do this...i would like the dx version...      	1
	no replacement for real books.i shudder to think that this metal/electronic thing may someday replace books altogether.	1
	it hurts my eyes to read on it and no matter how hard i try, i can't cuddle up with it on the couch or in front of a fireplace.	1
	i can't finger the pages or flip back and forth.	1
	(sorry, 'scrolling' just isn't the same thing.)	1
	books, with their attendant design and various typefaces, are works of art -- total art.	1
	this thing is just a machine.	1
	reading is a total experience, and this gadget doesn't make it.	1
	it's no harder to carry a book around than to carry this cold, impersonal piece of junk.	1
	don't waste your money!      	1

1465060265230319621	since no way home is coming out this is a friendly reminder that into the spider-verse is an easy 10/10, and that the best live action spiderman is about an 8/10 at best. spider-verse is literally leagues above any other spider-man movie	202

1465039120154214400	the ideas that spiders don't crawl down your throat at night in hordes is a social construct. you can't prove that they don't climb into your mouth and fill your nasal cavities, burrowing into your skull to birth their children in the masses	8

1464696256714842116	@lakercentral365 yupp. everyone gets held accountable. they assured us they had things handled. whether that be financially, roster wise or strategically. . so it should be an all across the board type deal.	3
